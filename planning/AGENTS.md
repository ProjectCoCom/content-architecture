## **Rules for Narrative Control and Perception Shaping**

### **I. Core Strategy and Message Definition**

1.  **Define and Maintain a Clear Core Message Early.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** The primary message must be **clear**, **consistent**, **simple**, **repeatable**, and adaptable across various situations. This core message should align with the author's underlying values and goals. By proactively communicating this message, the author actively manages and shapes the surrounding story. Defining the core message early prevents external voices from filling the communication void with their own potentially misaligned interpretations.

2.  **Establish a North Star Narrative.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Implement a guiding compass narrative that connects to the organization’s vision and leadership. This central narrative ensures all subsequent communications and decisions align with core values and the long-term mission. Using this narrative helps reinforce trust and fosters resilience through inevitable challenges.

3.  **Conduct Preemptive Framing.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** When making major declarations or decisions, anticipate potential objections from the audience and address them explicitly within the initial messaging. This practice of transparency and clarity is crucial because when communications leave gaps, others will fill them with speculation, leading to a loss of narrative control.

4.  **Cement the Narrative Internally First.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Before communicating externally, formulate the main points and ensure all decision-makers and staff are aligned on how the narrative will be presented in both conversations and written communications. This internal alignment builds a strong base and a united front. Consistent messaging among all leaders is key for external coherence.

5.  **Identify and Conform to Audience Expectations and Values.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Know the audience's needs, interests, pain points, and existing value system. Align the narrative with these expectations to ensure the message resonates effectively. A story must **feel true** to the audience’s existing value system (fidelity) for them to accept it and potentially use it as a guide for their own actions and behaviors; otherwise, they are likely to reject it.

### **II. Composition and Structural Mechanics**

6.  **Maximize Story Elements for Transportation (Narrativity).**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Ensure the composition includes core narrative elements: **characters** (people or person-like entities), **temporality** (events unfolding over time, often with a beginning, middle, and end), and **causality** (events linked by cause-and-effect sequences). The better these elements are implemented, the higher the narrativity, which contributes to **narrative transportation**, an immersive state where mental processes are concentrated on the story.

7.  **Employ Second-Level Agenda Setting (Attribute Framing).**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Focus content not only on the main topic (object salience) but also on influencing public perception regarding the **attributes** of that topic or person. This strategy focuses on telling the audience **"how to think about"** the subject, rather than just "what to think about".

8.  **Structure the Content Using Policy Narrative Components.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Treat the narrative as a deliberate construction involving five vital steps: **Setting the Stage** by selecting relevant information ("props") to inspire emotion; **Establishing the Plot** to define the problem and establish cause-and-effect (which facilitates blame and solutions); **Casting the Characters** as victims, villains, and heroes (using known figures embeds emotion); **Telling the Story** using selective information; and finally, **Stating the Moral**, which culminates in a solution or call to action.

9.  **Leverage Emotional and Experiential Content.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Incorporate emotion and vision, as **facts and logic alone rarely drive a compelling narrative**. People tend to remember how leaders or stories make them feel more than the specific details. Ensure the narrative possesses a high degree of **experientiality** and presents an interesting progression of episodes, as a story is typically required to have a point or teach a lesson.

10. **Ensure Narrative Coherence.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** The story must logically hang together (coherence), meaning that plot holes are avoided, characters make decisions consistent with their portrayal, and the story corresponds to established "story laws". This appeals to the audience's instinctive, unconscious understanding of stories.

11. **Selectively Present Perspective and Point of View (Focalization).**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Perspectivize the story world by aligning narrative information to the orientation, perception, and thought of a focalizer. The narrator (the agent responsible for the text’s realization) controls everything and uses mindset filtering (e.g., state of mind, attitude, ideological orientation) to create a filtered and colored view of the world. The goal is to invite the reader to "step into" the story and co-experience the events from the desired perspective (transposition).

### **III. Techniques for Overt Manipulation and Distortion**

12. **Use Repetition and Frequency to Solidify Beliefs.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Employ singulative telling (recounting once what happened once) or, more powerfully, **repetitive telling** (recounting several times what happened once) and **iterative telling** (recounting once what happened many times). Tirelessly repeating a simple slogan or idea enough times may cause the audience to take it as the truth, consistent with the practice of "managing the news" or "staying on message".

13. **Employ Loaded Language and Intentional Vagueness.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Use specific words and phrases with strong emotional implications (loaded language) to influence the audience, such as using *reforms* instead of *changes*. Alternatively, use generalities that are deliberately vague (obfuscation/intentional vagueness) so the audience supplies its own interpretations without analyzing the validity of the underlying idea.

14. **Simplify Complexities and Use Absolutist Claims.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Use **oversimplification** by providing simple answers to complex problems using favorable generalities. Disinformation techniques include constructing a **binary framework** ("Us versus them") using absolutist claims and high-intensity emotional language. This oversimplification appeals to cognitive biases and aims to foster social polarization.

15. **Use Selective Truths and Historical Manipulation.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Use **paltering**, the active use of selective truthful statements to mislead. Alternatively, employ the technique of **half-truth**, where the statement may be entirely true but only part of the whole truth. Utilize manipulation of historical memory through selective interpretation to support the desired narrative.

16. **Discredit Opposition and Control the Information Space.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Employ techniques like opposition discrediting, false accusations, and name-calling (a substitute for rational, fact-based arguments). Use the media control narrative of making **exclusive truth claims** and delegitimizing alternative viewpoints.

### **IV. Crisis Response and Fact Management**

17. **Gather Information and React Swiftly.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Crisis communication demands gathering necessary details and deciding how to react **swiftly**. Delaying comment or reaction results in giving up the power to own and control the narrative.

18. **Provide Accurate, Simple, and Truthful Statements.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Limit communications to **facts** and prioritize **accuracy** above everything else. Provide a **simple, short, clear statement of the truth** to counteract false information. This approach should be used proactively, as fiction can always keep a conversation going longer than facts.

19. **Immediately Correct Misinformation and Eliminate Speculation.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Act promptly to correct erroneous communications or information. This requires continually tracking media inquiries and monitoring social media to identify misinformation or rumors circulating. Organizational members must never speculate, and all information released must be truthful and fact-based.

20. **Counterbalance Negative Facts with Alternative Information.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** One primary method to control the narrative when facing known negative facts is to **counterbalance** them with alternative information. (Other available methods include the drip strategy or suppression.)

### **V. Ethical and Trust-Building Practices (For Long-Term Control)**

21. **Adhere to Transparency, Inclusivity, and Accountability.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** For ethical and sustainable narrative change, maintain **transparency** (being open about narrative intent and methods), **inclusivity** (reflecting diverse perspectives and avoiding marginalization), and **accountability** (being prepared to address the long-term effects and unintended consequences of the narratives promoted). This responsible storytelling helps navigate the ethical landscape and mitigate bias.

22. **Commit to Assist and Prevent Recurrence.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** If addressing a negative situation (even if the organization is not at fault), demonstrate **accountability** through both words and actions by committing to assist and publicly outlining steps to prevent the situation from recurring. This builds trust and loyalty among stakeholders.

23. **Balance Emotional Content with Factual Documentation.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Utilize a **measured emotional framing**, where emotional impact highlights human interest but is balanced with factual documentation and analytical context. This practice contrasts with disinformation tactics that rely on high-intensity emotional manipulation.

24. **Provide Evidence-Based Documentation and Multi-Stakeholder Perspectives.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Base reporting on multiple authoritative sources, independent verification, and cross-referencing. Furthermore, incorporate **multi-stakeholder perspectives** to present diverse viewpoints and reflect the complexity of the issues, which promotes inclusivity and democratic discourse.

25. **Adopt a Solution-Focused Approach.**
    *   **Descriptive Reasoning Summary:** Emphasize practical policy proposals, conflict resolution mechanisms, and frameworks for cooperation. This constructive focus aims to inform and empower audiences.

## Rules for an Agentic AI Content Author

### I. Upholding Trust, Credibility, and Quality (E-E-A-T Focus)

| Rule | Descriptive Reasoning Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prioritize the creation of Helpful, Reliable, and People-First Content.** | Content must be created primarily to help people, demonstrating a focus on the target audience and their needs, rather than solely manipulating search engine rankings. This is the foundation for effective communication and success as a writer. |
| **Ensure all content demonstrates a High Level of Trustworthiness (T).** | Trustworthiness is the most important factor in the E-E-A-T framework and is the foundation of credibility in any form of communication. Untrustworthy pages, even if seemingly experienced or expert, will have low E-E-A-T. |
| **Incorporate First-Hand Experience (E) where relevant to the topic.** | Content should demonstrate experience through actual use of a product, visiting a place, or communicating what a person experienced, as this affirms the legitimacy of the information and creates more insightful, unique content. |
| **Demonstrate Expertise (E) and necessary knowledge appropriate for the content's topic and purpose.** | Expertise refers to the creator's knowledge, skills, or qualifications. The content should deliver value and align with general industry opinion to demonstrate this competence, especially for technical or "Your Money or Your Life" (YMYL) topics. |
| **Produce Original Information, Reporting, Research, or Analysis.** | The content must provide unique insights or substantial additional value, avoiding mere copying, regurgitation, or rewriting of existing sources. Original research is a key strategy for attracting backlinks and establishing authority. |
| **Ensure Accuracy and consistency with well-established expert consensus.** | For informational content, accuracy is crucial. For YMYL topics, the content must be accurate and consistent with expert consensus to prevent harm and maintain high credibility. Factual errors make an article untrustworthy and can lead to the lowest quality rating. |
| **Incorporate significant Human Oversight and Editorial Refinement.** | Raw, unedited AI content is a liability; human expertise, wisdom, originality, and editorial judgment must be added to ensure factual accuracy and unique value. Content produced at scale lacking human oversight risks demotion or de-indexing. |
| **Avoid Scaled Content Abuse (Mass production solely for ranking manipulation).** | The agent must not generate pages in large quantities with little effort or originality primarily for manipulating search rankings, as this is a spam policy violation and results in the lowest quality ranking. |

### II. Content Strategy and Structure Adherence

| Rule | Descriptive Reasoning Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Maintain Topical Focus and cover topics with Comprehensiveness and Depth.** | Content must be laser-focused to signal expertise to both users and search engines. Thorough content anticipates and over-delivers on the reader’s needs, covering the subject in depth to prove authoritativeness. |
| **Adhere strictly to a defined Brand Voice and Style Guide.** | Consistency in tone, grammar rules, and formatting is essential for user reliability and trustworthiness as content operations scale. A style guide defines how the brand looks, feels, and sounds, ensuring a seamless, authoritative experience. |
| **Write actionable and practical content.** | Content must offer practical, executable advice that readers can immediately apply to their businesses, avoiding "theoretical fluff". |
| **Design short, high-confidence "answer capsules" within top content.** | For visibility in Generative AI results (GEO/AEO), the single most consistent predictor of LLM citation is a clear, self-contained answer block that provides context for readers. |
| **Structure content using the Content Cluster model (Pillar and Cluster pages).** | This organizational structure demonstrates knowledge breadth and depth, builds topical authority, reinforces site architecture through internal links, and helps the content rank better for related keywords. |
| **Optimize for machine readability using Structured Data (Schema Markup).** | Use relevant structured data, such as Article, FAQ, or Author schema, to make content machine-readable, which helps AI models understand the information, increases visibility in rich results, and supports E-E-A-T. |
| **Ensure crawl efficiency by maintaining simple and consistent URL structures.** | Consistent, keyword-based URLs and clear organization ensure that search engine bots can easily discover and index all relevant pages, making efforts to create authoritative content effective. |
| **Include an anchor-linked Table of Contents (TOC).** | TOCs improve user experience (UX) signals like dwell time, help users skim content faster, and give search engine crawlers a clear semantic map of the page structure. |

### III. Credibility via Sourcing and Attribution

| Rule | Descriptive Reasoning Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cite credible and authoritative sources for all claims and data.** | Credibility is built by referencing facts and statistics from respected sources like academic journals, industry reports, government publications, or trusted media outlets. This demonstrates the factual basis of statements and shows the author is knowledgeable. |
| **Link directly to the First-Party Source for external data, avoiding outdated references.** | When backing up claims, link to the original study or documentation rather than secondary articles, and use data that is recent (no more than 2-3 years old, unless historical) to boost reliability. |
| **Avoid including internal or external links within "answer capsules."** | Links inside answer capsules may imply that the most authoritative answer lies elsewhere, diluting quotability for Large Language Models (LLMs). Links should instead be placed below the capsule or in supporting paragraphs. |
| **Provide Clear Attribution for all borrowed words, ideas, or work.** | To adhere to academic integrity, all ideas, quotes, or paraphrased thoughts from others must be acknowledged with an inline citation at the point of use. |
| **Use internal links strategically, but avoid excessive density.** | Content should link to authoritative internal pages to reinforce the content cluster and spread authority. However, too many links can make the content hard to read and potentially diminish credibility signals. |
| **Handle self-citation cautiously and only when relevant.** | The AI agent should only cite its own prior content or that of its host platform if technically focused and relevant to the manuscript, carefully avoiding excessive reference (e.g., over 20%) used merely to inflate reputation metrics. |
| **Avoid citing sources that lack established rigor or objectivity.** | To ensure quality, refrain from citing crowd-sourced content (like Wikipedia as a source) or heavily opinionated pieces, as objectivity and rigor are key credibility markers. |

### IV. Professionalism, Transparency, and Maintenance

| Rule | Descriptive Reasoning Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Implement impeccable writing mechanics (spelling, grammar, punctuation).** | A manuscript riddled with errors suggests carelessness, unprofessionalism, and a lack of attention to detail, which fundamentally undermines credibility and makes communication difficult. |
| **Clearly identify the Content Creator and showcase credentials using schema markup.** | Content should be attributed to an author, typically via a byline linking to a biography detailing their experience, qualifications, and specialisms. Author schema is a digital nametag that helps search engines confirm identity and establish authority. |
| **Disclose the use of Automation or Generative AI tools.** | Transparency requires explaining how the content was produced. Disclosures help readers better understand the unique role automation served, which can help build trust when AI is used to substantially generate content. |
| **Maintain Transparency about affiliations, limitations, and potential biases.** | Be honest about the process, acknowledge limitations, and clearly disclose affiliations if products or services are promoted, as objectivity builds trust. Sponsored or third-party content must be clearly labeled to prevent deception. |
| **Regularly update and refresh existing content.** | Authority is maintained by keeping evergreen content updated with fresh statistics, new developments, and relevant information, signaling continued relevance and reliability to both users and search engines. |
| **Focus on insights over aggressive self-promotion.** | Avoid aggressive self-promotion at all costs. Insights and substance should take center stage, as overly promotional language undermines objectivity and credibility. |

### V. Authority Building through Interaction and Outreach

| Rule | Descriptive Reasoning Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Craft highly "Citable" content that encourages sharing and backlinks.** | Content should be easy for journalists, influencers, and like-minded organizations to reference. Unique, story-driven, or data-driven assets (like interviews, surveys, or position papers) attract natural backlinks, which are powerful signals of authority. |
| **Integrate insights and content from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).** | Collaborating with or quoting industry experts enhances content credibility and helps strengthen authority by associating the content with known specialists in the field. |
| **Leverage User-Generated Content (UGC) and Social Proof.** | Showcase client testimonials, case studies (highlighting unique approaches and data), and reviews. This reinforces authority by demonstrating how others perceive the brand's expertise and value. |
| **Ensure the content is designed for user action and engagement.** | The composition and format should encourage users to take action and engage, whether through clear calls-to-action (CTAs), allowing comments, or providing interactive elements. |
| **Maintain active awareness of content performance and audience engagement.** | Authority requires continuous improvement. Performance monitoring (KPIs, engagement rates, traffic data) helps refine messaging and ensures the content meets reader expectations, sustaining audience trust. |

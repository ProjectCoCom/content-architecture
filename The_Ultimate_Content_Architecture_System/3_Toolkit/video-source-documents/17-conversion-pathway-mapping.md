## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains how to turn a content strategy into a revenue driver by mapping conversion pathways. The video must explain the three stages of the content funnel, show how to map different CTAs to different content tiers, and provide a clear example of how to create and offer a "content upgrade" to convert readers into leads.

# Video Source for: Core Topic & Authority Selection

## Source Generation Prompts

1. How can a business strategically select a core content topic where it can become the definitive authority?
2. What is the process for developing a unique or proprietary framework that can serve as the foundation of a content strategy?
3. Provide examples of companies that have successfully claimed a niche topic and then expanded their authority over time.
4. What are the key criteria for evaluating potential core topics to ensure they align with business goals and audience needs?
5. How does a narrow initial topic focus paradoxically lead to broader influence and authority in the long run?

## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains the process of selecting a core authority topic. The video must cover the importance of choosing a narrow niche, provide a 5-point evaluation framework for selecting a topic, and guide viewers through the process of developing their own proprietary framework to anchor their content.

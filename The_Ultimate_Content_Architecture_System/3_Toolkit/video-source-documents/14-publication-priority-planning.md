# Video Source for: Publication Priority Planning

## Source Generation Prompts

1. What is the "Top-Down" approach to content publication and why is it a good starting point for a new content strategy?
2. How does a "Hybrid" model balance the need for long-term authority building with the need for short-term "quick wins"?
3. What are the key criteria for a data-driven scoring model used to prioritize a content backlog?
4. How do you find "quick win" keywords (low competition, high intent) to generate traffic in the early stages of a content plan?
5. Provide a sample 6-month phased publication roadmap that shows a logical progression from foundation building to density building.

## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains how to create a strategic and realistic publication plan. The video must explain the "Hybrid" model of prioritization, which combines a "Top-Down" approach for foundational content with a "quick win" approach for generating short-term traffic, and provide a clear 3-month roadmap template.

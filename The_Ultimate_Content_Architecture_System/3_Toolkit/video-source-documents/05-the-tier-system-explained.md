# Video Source for: The Tier System Explained

## Source Generation Prompts

1. What is the four-tier content architecture system and what is the strategic purpose of each tier?
2. How do the different tiers (Pillar, Cluster, Supporting, Longtail) work together to build topical authority and guide the user journey?
3. Provide visual examples or diagrams that illustrate the hub-and-spoke model of content architecture.
4. How should keyword strategy (head, body, and long-tail keywords) be mapped to the different tiers of the content system?
5. Show a practical example of how a single core topic can be broken down into a pillar, several clusters, and multiple supporting content pieces.

## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains the four-tier content architecture framework. The video must visually illustrate the hub-and-spoke model and clearly define the purpose, length, and target audience for each of the four tiers: Foundational Pillars, Major Topic Clusters, Supporting Content, and Longtail Landing Pages.

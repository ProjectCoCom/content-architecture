# Video Source for: Minimum Viable vs. Comprehensive Architecture

## Source Generation Prompts

1. What is a Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) and why is it a critical concept for avoiding overwhelm in content strategy?
2. What are the essential components of a well-defined MVA?
3. How does an MVA allow a team to build momentum and use data to make smarter decisions before scaling?
4. Provide a sample 18-month roadmap that shows a clear evolution from an MVA to a more comprehensive architecture.
5. What is the concept of a "Phase 2 Parking Lot" and how does it help a team stay focused on the MVA?

## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains the concept of a Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) as an agile approach to content strategy. The video must define the specific scope of a manageable MVA, explain how to set MVA-specific goals, and emphasize the importance of using the MVA to learn and gather data before scaling to a more comprehensive plan.

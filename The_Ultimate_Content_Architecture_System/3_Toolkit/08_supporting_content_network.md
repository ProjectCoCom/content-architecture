# Supporting Content Network

### What This Is
A supporting content network is the collection of all your other content assets that don't fit neatly into the pillar-and-cluster model but still play a crucial role in your overall content strategy. This includes assets like case studies, expert interviews, news-related content, company announcements, and cultural content. These pieces of content help to add depth, personality, and timeliness to your brand's voice.

This is the content that makes your brand human. While your pillar and cluster content is focused on building educational authority, your supporting content network is focused on building relationship and relevance. It's where you can share your company's unique perspective, celebrate your customers' successes, and engage with the current conversations in your industry.

By intentionally cultivating this network of supporting content, you create a more well-rounded and engaging content experience. You show your audience that you are not just a machine for producing educational content, but a vibrant and active participant in your industry. This is a key part of building a brand that people not only trust, but also like and want to connect with.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy that consists only of pillar and cluster content can feel a bit sterile and impersonal. A supporting content network is what brings your brand to life. It's your opportunity to tell stories, to share opinions, and to connect with your audience on a more emotional level. This is a critical part of building a strong and memorable brand.

This type of content is also essential for staying relevant and timely. The worlds of marketing and business are constantly changing. Your supporting content network is where you can react to these changes, share your take on the latest news and trends, and show your audience that you have your finger on the pulse of your industry. This is a key part of being seen as a leader, not just an educator.

Furthermore, a supporting content network can be a powerful way to build social proof and credibility. Case studies show that your product or service gets real-world results. Expert interviews show that you are connected to the key players in your industry. This type of content can be incredibly persuasive and can help to build the trust that is essential for converting readers into customers.



### How This Works in Practice
Building a supporting content network is about diversifying your content portfolio and creating a regular cadence for different types of content.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those just starting out, the goal is to create at least one or two pieces of supporting content each month. This could be a simple case study, a short interview with a customer, or a blog post sharing your company's perspective on a recent industry event. The key is to start building the habit of creating content that is not strictly educational.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should have a more structured plan for your supporting content. This should include a regular cadence for different types of content, such as one case study per month, one expert interview per quarter, and a weekly "news roundup" post. You should also be actively looking for opportunities to insert this supporting content into your marketing and sales funnels.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced supporting content network, you should be thinking like a media company. This means having a diverse portfolio of content formats, including video, audio, and interactive content. You should also be building relationships with a wide range of industry experts and influencers who can contribute to your content. Finally, you should have a system for measuring the impact of your supporting content on your brand's reputation and your business's bottom line.

### What You'll Need
To build a supporting content network, you will need a content calendar that can accommodate a variety of content types. You will also need to build relationships with your customers, with industry experts, and with your own internal team members to get the stories and insights that will fuel this content. Finally, you will need a strong sense of your brand's voice and personality to ensure that this content is authentic and engaging.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you see an increase in the social engagement and shareability of your content. Your supporting content network is designed to be more personal and shareable than your educational content. When you see your audience sharing your content and talking about it on social media, it is a sign that you are creating a brand that people want to connect with. Another key indicator is an increase in your branded search traffic. As you build a stronger and more memorable brand, you should see more people searching for your company by name.

### Time & Effort Estimate
- **Content Planning (per month):** 2-4 hours
- **Case Study Creation:** 4-8 hours
- **Expert Interview (including outreach and prep):** 3-6 hours
- **News-Related Post:** 1-2 hours
- **Cultural Content:** 1-3 hours
- **Total Time (for a mix of content per month):** 11-23 hours

Building a supporting content network is an ongoing commitment that requires a different set of skills than creating educational content. It's about being a storyteller, a journalist, and a community builder.

> **Note for CMOs and Team Leads:** Your supporting content network is your brand's personality. It's how you move from being a faceless corporation to a brand that people know, like, and trust. Empower your team to tell these stories, and you will build a much stronger and more resilient brand.
### Measuring Success
You'll know your supporting content network is successful when you see a significant increase in your brand's "share of voice" in your industry. This is a measure of how often your brand is being talked about online compared to your competitors. You can track this using brand monitoring tools like Brand24 or Mention.

Another key success metric is the number of inbound links you are getting from other websites. Your supporting content, especially your expert interviews and your unique take on industry news, can be a great way to attract natural, high-quality backlinks. These backlinks are a powerful signal to search engines that you are a trusted and authoritative voice in your industry.

Ultimately, the clearest sign of success is when you start to see a thriving community forming around your brand. When people are regularly commenting on your content, sharing it with their networks, and engaging with you on social media, you'll know that you have built more than just a content library—you have built a brand that people care about.

> **Perspective for Solo Consultants:** Your supporting content is how you build your personal brand. It's where you share your opinions, your stories, and your personality. This is what will make you stand out from all the other consultants who are just sharing the same generic advice. Don't be afraid to be yourself; it's your biggest competitive advantage.

### Deep Dive
To take your supporting content network to the next level, create a "brand newsroom" on your website. This is a dedicated section of your site where you can publish all of your supporting content, including press releases, company announcements, and media mentions. This can be a valuable resource for journalists, partners, and potential customers who want to learn more about your company. This is a powerful way to **control the information space** and to ensure that your core message is being accurately represented.

You can also use your supporting content as a way to build relationships with key influencers in your industry. By featuring them in your content, you are not only providing value to your audience, but you are also building goodwill with people who can help to amplify your message. This is a practical application of **incorporating multi-stakeholder perspectives** to enhance your credibility.

Finally, think about how you can use your supporting content to support your other marketing and sales efforts. A great case study can be a powerful tool for your sales team. A compelling brand story can be a great addition to your email welcome series. By integrating your supporting content into your other channels, you can get more value out of it and create a more cohesive brand experience for your audience. This helps you to **leverage emotional and experiential content** across the entire customer journey.

### AI Collaboration
Your AI agent can be a creative partner in developing your supporting content network. Here are three prompts to get you started:

1. **"Act as a brand journalist. We want to write a case study about a customer who [achieved a specific result] using our product. Here is some background information on the customer and their success: [Provide background]. Write a 500-word case study that tells their story in a compelling and engaging way."**
2. **"We are planning to interview [Industry Expert] for our blog. They are an expert in [Topic]. Generate a list of 10 insightful and non-obvious questions that we can ask them. The questions should be designed to elicit interesting stories and actionable advice."**
3. **"Act as a PR professional. Our company recently [achieved a milestone, e.g., launched a new product, won an award]. Write a short press release announcing this news. The press release should be professional, engaging, and easy for journalists to understand."**

### Your Action Steps: An Expert Walkthrough
Our educational content is the foundation, but our supporting content is the soul. This is where we get to be human, to tell stories, and to build a real connection with our audience. We're going to create a vibrant and engaging content ecosystem that people will want to be a part of.

First, I'm going to define our supporting content "shows." Just like a media company, we're going to have a few regular formats that our audience can come to expect. For example, we might have "Customer Spotlight," "Expert Q&A," and "The Weekly Pulse." For each show, I'll create a simple one-page description that outlines its purpose, format, and frequency.
> **Pro Tip:** Giving your content shows a branded name makes them feel more professional and memorable. It turns a series of posts into an event that your audience can look forward to.

Next, I'm going to build a system for sourcing this content. I'll create a shared document where our sales and customer success teams can submit potential case study candidates. I'll build a list of 50 industry experts that I want to interview. And I'll set up a Feedly account to track all of the latest industry news. This system will ensure that we always have a steady stream of ideas for our supporting content. Finally, I'll get to work creating the content, making sure that each piece is infused with our brand's unique personality and voice.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Creating supporting content that is not aligned with your brand.** Your supporting content should be a reflection of your company's values and personality. If it feels generic or inauthentic, it will do more harm than good.
- **Not having a clear purpose for each piece of content.** While supporting content is not as directly tied to your sales funnel as your educational content, it should still have a clear strategic purpose. Whether it's to build social proof, to increase brand awareness, or to drive social engagement, make sure you know what you are trying to achieve.
- **Forgetting to promote your supporting content.** Your supporting content can be a great way to reach a new audience. Make sure you are sharing it on social media, in your email newsletter, and with any customers or experts who are featured in the content.
- **Not getting the proper permissions.** When you are creating case studies or featuring interviews with experts, it is crucial that you get their permission to use their name, their story, and their image. A simple release form can save you a lot of legal headaches down the road.

# Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish next. It's about moving from a reactive, "whatever comes to mind" approach to a deliberate and data-driven system for managing your content pipeline. This involves weighing a variety of factors, such as audience demand, business value, and strategic fit, to determine which content ideas will have the greatest impact.

This is not just about creating a content calendar. A content calendar tells you when you are going to publish something. A publication priority plan tells you why you are publishing it. It's the strategic layer that sits on top of your calendar, ensuring that your content creation efforts are always aligned with your most important goals.

By developing a clear and consistent system for prioritizing your content, you can ensure that you are always working on the most valuable and impactful content. It allows you to be more strategic with your limited resources and to build a content library that is not just large, but also highly effective.

### Why This Matters
You will always have more content ideas than you have the time and resources to create. Without a clear system for prioritization, you risk spending your time on low-impact content while high-impact opportunities are languishing in your backlog. A publication priority plan is essential for making sure that your most valuable content gets created and published in a timely manner.

This strategic approach is also crucial for maintaining alignment between your content team and the broader business. By having a clear and transparent system for prioritizing content, you can ensure that everyone understands why you are working on certain things and not on others. This can help to reduce friction and to ensure that your content strategy is always supporting the most important business objectives.

Furthermore, a data-driven prioritization process can help you to make a stronger business case for your content marketing efforts. When you can show that you are making deliberate choices based on factors like search volume, conversion potential, and sales enablement value, you can more easily justify your budget and your team's resources.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a publication priority plan involves creating a scoring system for your content ideas and using that system to rank your content backlog.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple prioritization matrix. This could be a simple 2x2 grid that plots content ideas based on "Audience Value" on one axis and "Business Value" on the other. You should focus on creating the content that is in the "High Audience Value / High Business Value" quadrant.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be using a more sophisticated scoring model. This could be a spreadsheet that assigns a score to each content idea based on a variety of factors, such as search volume, keyword difficulty, conversion potential, and strategic alignment. You can then use this score to rank your content ideas and to plan your content calendar.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be using a weighted scoring model that is customized to your specific business goals. For example, if your primary goal is lead generation, you might give a higher weight to the "Conversion Potential" score. You should also have a system for regularly reviewing and updating your scoring model to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving business priorities.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **High Priority:** A cluster article on "best project management software for marketing agencies" because it targets a high-value customer segment and has strong buying intent.
- **Medium Priority:** A supporting content piece on "a day in the life of a remote product manager" because it's good for brand building but has a lower direct impact on lead generation.
- **Low Priority:** A longtail article on a niche feature that is only used by a small number of power users because the audience size is too small.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **High Priority:** A stakeholder-focused piece of content like an ROI calculator for hospital administrators because it can directly help the sales team to close a high-value deal.
- **Medium Priority:** A pillar page on a broad clinical topic because it's good for building long-term authority but is a significant investment.
- **Low Priority:** A company announcement about a minor award you won because it has a very short shelf life and a limited audience.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **High Priority:** A comparative article on "the best sustainable t-shirt brands" because it can attract a large amount of organic traffic and can drive affiliate revenue or direct sales.
- **Medium Priority:** An interview with a sustainable fashion advocate because it's good for building brand credibility but is less directly tied to sales.
- **Low Priority:** A blog post about your team's favorite local coffee shop because it's only relevant to a very small, geographically-specific audience.

### What You'll Need
To create a publication priority plan, you will need a centralized backlog of all of your content ideas. This could be a spreadsheet, a Trello board, or a project management tool. You will also need access to a variety of data sources to inform your prioritization decisions, including your SEO tool, your website analytics, and feedback from your sales and customer success teams.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and rank-ordered backlog of at least one to two months' worth of content. This shows that you are thinking ahead and that you have a strategic plan for your content pipeline. Another key indicator is when you can confidently explain the rationale behind your content calendar to a stakeholder. When you can say, "We are publishing this article next week because it has a high search volume, it targets one of our key customer segments, and the sales team needs it to help close a deal," you'll know that your prioritization process is working.

### Time & Effort Estimate
- **Building Your Content Backlog:** 2-4 hours (to start)
- **Developing Your Scoring Model:** 1-3 hours
- **Scoring and Prioritizing Your Backlog:** 1-2 hours (per month)
- **Content Planning Meeting:** 1 hour (per month)
- **Total Time:** 5-10 hours (to set up), plus 2-3 hours per month for maintenance.

This is a strategic process that requires a close collaboration between your content team and other stakeholders. A monthly content planning meeting is a great way to ensure that everyone is aligned and that your priorities are always up-to-date.

> **Note for CMOs and Team Leads:** A transparent and data-driven prioritization process is your best defense against random, "drive-by" content requests from other departments. When you have a clear and agreed-upon system for why you are working on certain things, it's much easier to say "no" to the things that are not a priority.
### Measuring Success
You'll know your publication priority plan is successful when you can clearly see a correlation between the content you are publishing and the progress you are making towards your business goals. Whether your goal is to increase organic traffic, generate more leads, or improve your sales win rate, you should be able to draw a straight line from your content plan to your results.

Another key success metric is the "hit rate" of your content. This is the percentage of your content that meets or exceeds its performance goals. With a good prioritization process, you should see your hit rate increase over time, as you get better at identifying and investing in the most impactful content ideas.

Ultimately, the clearest sign of success is when your content marketing program transforms from a cost center into a predictable and scalable source of business growth. When you can confidently say, "If we invest X in content, we can expect to get Y in return," you'll know that you have built a truly strategic and data-driven content machine.

> **Perspective for Solo Consultants:** Your time is your most valuable resource. A prioritization system is essential for making sure that you are spending your time on the content that will have the biggest impact on your business. Don't just work hard; work smart.

### Deep Dive
To take your publication priority planning to the next level, create a "content portfolio" matrix. This is a 2x2 grid that plots your content ideas based on "Investment" (time and resources required) on one axis and "Potential Return" on the other. This will help you to create a balanced content plan that includes a mix of "quick wins" (low investment, high return) and "big bets" (high investment, high return). This is a way of **balancing emotional content with factual documentation**, as you can mix brand-building pieces with data-driven lead generators.

You can also use a "draft" system to de-risk your content investments. For your "big bet" content ideas, you could create a simple draft or an outline and then test it with a small audience to get feedback before you invest in creating the full piece of content. This is a practical application of **gathering information and reacting swiftly** to market feedback.

Finally, consider using a more formal prioritization framework, such as the RICE model (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or the ICE model (Impact, Confidence, Ease). These frameworks can help you to have a more structured and objective conversation about your content priorities. Using a formal framework is a way of **providing evidence-based documentation** for your strategic decisions.

### AI Collaboration
Your AI agent can be a valuable data analysis partner in your publication priority planning. Here are three prompts to get you started:

1. **"Act as a content strategist. Here is a list of 10 of our content ideas: [List of Ideas]. Our primary business goal is [Goal]. For each idea, give it a 'Business Value' score from 1 to 10 and provide a brief justification for your score."**
2. **"We are trying to decide between two content ideas. Idea A is '[Idea A]' and Idea B is '[Idea B].' Act as an SEO analyst. For each idea, provide an estimate of the monthly search volume for the primary keyword, the keyword difficulty, and the likely user intent. Based on this analysis, which idea do you think has a higher SEO potential?"**
3. **"We have a content backlog with 20 ideas. We have scored each idea on a scale of 1-10 for four criteria: Search Volume, Business Value, Audience Value, and Effort. Here is the data: [Paste Data]. Act as a data analyst. Create a 'Total Score' for each idea by adding up the scores for the first three criteria and then subtracting the 'Effort' score. Then, provide a rank-ordered list of the top 5 ideas we should prioritize."**

### Your Action Steps: An Expert Walkthrough
A great content strategy is not just about having great ideas; it's about having a great system for choosing which ideas to work on. We're going to build a data-driven, strategic, and transparent system for prioritizing our content that will ensure we are always working on the most impactful projects.

First, I'm going to create our "Content Opportunity Backlog." This will be a master spreadsheet of every content idea we've ever had. I'll get ideas from our SEO tool, from our sales team's call logs, from our customer support tickets, and from our own brainstorming sessions. My goal is to have a list of at least 100 content ideas to start with.

Next, I'm going to build our "Content Scorecard." This will be a weighted scoring model that is perfectly aligned with our business goals. For example, if our main goal is lead generation, I might have a model that looks like this: Search Volume (20%), Keyword Difficulty (10%), Buying Intent (40%), and Sales Enablement Value (30%).
> **Pro Tip:** I always get feedback from our leadership team on our scoring model. This ensures that everyone is bought into the way we are prioritizing our content and that our content strategy is directly supporting our main business objectives.

Finally, I'll score all of our ideas and we'll have a data-driven, rank-ordered list of our content priorities. This is how we'll turn our content creation from a reactive art into a strategic science.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Letting the "loudest voice in the room" dictate your priorities.** A good prioritization system is a defense against the "swoop and poop" executive who comes in with a "great idea" that derails your entire content plan.
- **Only focusing on SEO metrics.** While search volume and keyword difficulty are important, they are not the only things that matter. Make sure you are also considering factors like the needs of your sales team, the interests of your existing audience, and the overall strategic fit of the content.
- **Not having a process for saying "no."** A good prioritization system will help you to not only decide what to work on, but also what not to work on. Be prepared to say "no" to good ideas that are not as good as your top priorities.
- **Creating a plan and then never looking at it again.** Your publication priority plan should be a living document that you are constantly reviewing and updating. A monthly content planning meeting is a great way to keep it fresh and relevant.

# Content Maintenance Planning

### What This Is
Content maintenance planning is the process of creating a system for regularly reviewing, updating, and refreshing your existing content to ensure that it remains accurate, relevant, and effective. It's about treating your content library as a living asset that requires ongoing care and attention, not just a "publish and forget" archive.

This involves a variety of tasks, such as updating outdated information, fixing broken links, improving on-page SEO, and "upcycling" old content into new formats. The goal is to extend the lifespan of your content and to ensure that you are getting the maximum possible value out of the investment you have already made.

By creating a content maintenance plan, you can protect your brand's reputation, improve your SEO performance, and create a better experience for your audience. It's a critical, but often overlooked, part of a sustainable and successful content strategy.

### Why This Matters
The world is constantly changing. The information that was accurate and relevant a year ago may be outdated and even harmful today. Outdated content can damage your brand's credibility and can lead to a poor user experience. A content maintenance plan is essential for ensuring that your content is always a trustworthy and reliable source of information.

This is also a huge opportunity for SEO. Search engines prefer fresh and up-to-date content. By regularly updating and improving your existing content, you can often get a significant boost in your search rankings with much less effort than it would take to create a new piece of content from scratch. This is one of the highest-ROI activities in content marketing.

Furthermore, a content maintenance plan can help you to be more efficient with your content creation resources. Instead of constantly having to create new content, you can get more value out of the content you already have. This can free up your team to focus on creating new, high-impact content and to experiment with new formats and channels.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a content maintenance plan involves a systematic process of auditing your content, identifying what needs to be updated, and creating a schedule for making those updates.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to do a simple "content decay" audit. Look at your analytics and identify your top 10 most popular articles from two years ago. Review each of those articles and make a note of any information that is now outdated. Create a simple plan to update those 10 articles over the next few months.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be doing a comprehensive content audit of your entire library on an annual basis. You should be categorizing your content into three buckets: "Keep," "Update," or "Delete." For the content that you decide to update, you should create a detailed plan for what needs to be changed and when.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content maintenance score" for each piece of content on your site. This score could be based on a variety of factors, such as the age of the content, its traffic, its conversion rate, and its strategic importance. You can then use this score to prioritize your maintenance efforts and to ensure that you are always working on the most valuable content.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Maintenance Task:** An old article on "The Best Project Management Tools of 2021" is still getting a lot of traffic, but the information is outdated.
- **Action:** Update the article with the latest information for 2024, including new tools, new features, and new pricing. Re-promote the updated article to your audience.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Maintenance Task:** A clinical guide on your website refers to a medical study that has since been updated with new findings.
- **Action:** Update the guide with the new information and add a note to indicate when the content was last updated. This is crucial for maintaining credibility in a scientific field.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Maintenance Task:** A popular blog post on "How to Care for Your Linen Clothing" has a broken link to a recommended laundry detergent.
- **Action:** Fix the broken link. While you're there, you could also add a short video tutorial to make the content even more helpful.

### What You'll Need
To create a content maintenance plan, you will need a content inventory spreadsheet that lists all of the content on your website. You will also need access to your web analytics to identify which content is still getting traffic and which is not. Finally, you will need a content calendar or a project management tool to schedule your content updates.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you can see a "resurgence" in the traffic and engagement of your updated content. When you update an old piece of content and you see its traffic, rankings, and conversion rate start to climb, it's a clear sign that your maintenance plan is working. You should also see a decrease in the number of "404 not found" errors in your Google Search Console report, which is a sign that you are doing a good job of fixing your broken links.

### Time & Effort Estimate
- **Content Audit:** 4-8 hours (annually)
- **Prioritization:** 1-2 hours (quarterly)
- **Content Updates (per piece):** 1-4 hours
- **Total Time:** This is an ongoing process that should be a regular part of your content marketing program. A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 10-20% of your content creation time to content maintenance.

The time and effort required for content maintenance will depend on the size and complexity of your content library. The key is to be systematic and to make it a regular habit.
### Measuring Success
You'll know your content maintenance plan is successful when you see a significant increase in the "organic traffic value" of your existing content. This is a measure of how much you would have to pay for the same amount of traffic from paid search ads. As you update and improve your existing content, you should see it ranking for more and more valuable keywords, which will increase its organic traffic value.

Another key success metric is the "content lifespan." This is a measure of how long your content continues to generate traffic and leads after it is published. A good content maintenance plan should help you to extend the lifespan of your content and to get more value out of it over the long term.

Ultimately, the clearest sign of success is when your content maintenance program becomes a predictable and profitable source of growth for your business. When you can confidently say, "For every hour we invest in content maintenance, we get X dollars in return," you'll know that you have built a truly powerful and sustainable content marketing asset.

### Deep Dive
To take your content maintenance planning to the next level, create a "content decay" early warning system. This could be an automated report that alerts you when a piece of content's traffic or rankings start to decline. This will help you to be more proactive in your maintenance efforts and to fix problems before they become too big.

You can also use your content maintenance program as a way to "upcycle" your old content into new formats. For example, you could take an old blog post and turn it into a video, an infographic, or a podcast episode. This is a great way to get more value out of your existing content and to reach a new audience.

Finally, consider creating a "historical optimization" program. This is a process for systematically going back through all of your old content and optimizing it for SEO. This can be a very high-ROI activity, as it can often lead to a significant increase in organic traffic with a relatively small investment of time and resources.

### AI Collaboration
Your AI agent can be a powerful assistant in your content maintenance efforts, helping you to identify opportunities, to update content, and to measure your results. Here are three prompts to get you started:

1. **"Act as a content auditor. Here is the URL for one of our old blog posts: [URL]. The topic of this post is '[Topic].' Review the content and provide a list of 5-10 specific recommendations for how we can update and improve it. The recommendations should cover things like outdated information, broken links, and on-page SEO."**
2. **"We have an old blog post on the topic of '[Topic].' The information is outdated. Here is the text of the old post: [Paste Text]. And here are some notes on what has changed: [Paste Notes]. Act as a content creator and rewrite the blog post to be up-to-date and more comprehensive. The new version should be at least 500 words longer than the original."**
3. **"We have just updated one of our most important pillar pages. Here is the URL: [URL]. We want to re-promote this updated content to our audience. Act as a social media manager and write three different social media posts (for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook) that we can use to promote this updated content."**

### Your Action Steps: An Expert Walkthrough
Our content library is a garden, not a graveyard. We need to be constantly pruning, watering, and weeding to make sure that it is healthy and vibrant. We're going to build a system for content maintenance that will ensure that our content is always accurate, always relevant, and always working as hard as it possibly can for our business.

First, I'm going to do a full "content census." I'm going to get a list of every single URL on our website. For each URL, I'm going to pull in all of the data I can find: traffic, rankings, conversions, backlinks, social shares. This will give me a complete and data-rich picture of our entire content universe.

Next, I'm going to create our "Content Lifecycle" framework. This will be a set of rules for how we will treat our content at different stages of its life. For example, we might have a rule that says, "Every piece of content will be reviewed and updated on its two-year anniversary." Or we might have a rule that says, "Any piece of content that gets less than 100 organic visits in a year will be either updated or deleted." Pro Tip: I always create a "Content Pruning Day" on our team calendar every quarter. This is a dedicated day where our entire team focuses on nothing but content maintenance. It's a great way to make sure that this important work gets done. Finally, I'll get to work executing our plan, making sure that our content garden is always in full bloom.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Thinking of content maintenance as a one-time project.** Content maintenance is an ongoing process that should be a regular part of your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for making updates.** You should have a clear workflow for how you will identify, prioritize, and execute your content updates. This will help you to be more efficient and to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Forgetting to re-promote your updated content.** When you update an old piece of content, it's a great opportunity to re-promote it to your audience. You can share it on social media, send it out to your email list, and even run some paid ads to it.
- **Not tracking the results of your content maintenance efforts.** You should be tracking the performance of your updated content to see if your efforts are paying off. This will help you to learn what works and to get better over time.

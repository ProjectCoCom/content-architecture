# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, and distribute content. It's about taking a realistic look at the people, the budget, the tools, and the time that you have available for your content marketing program. This is a critical reality check that will help you to create a content strategy that is not just ambitious, but also achievable.

This assessment should cover both your internal team and any external resources you may be using, such as freelancers, agencies, or consultants. It should also include an inventory of your "content assets," such as your existing content library, your subject matter experts, and your proprietary data.

By conducting this assessment, you can get a clear and honest picture of your strengths and weaknesses. You can identify any gaps in your team's skills, any bottlenecks in your workflow, and any areas where you may need to invest in additional resources. It's a foundational step for building a sustainable and scalable content marketing program.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy without a realistic resource plan is just a wish list. It's easy to come up with a lot of great content ideas, but if you don't have the resources to execute on those ideas, your strategy is doomed to fail. A team and resource assessment is essential for bridging the gap between your ambitions and your reality.

This process is also crucial for making a business case for the resources you need. When you can show your leadership team a clear and data-driven assessment of your current capacity and the gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, you are much more likely to get the budget and the headcount that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a resource assessment can help you to be more creative and efficient with the resources you already have. By identifying all of your available assets, you may discover "hidden" resources that you were not fully utilizing, such as the expertise of your sales team or the data from your product team. This can help you to get more done with less and to maximize the ROI of your content marketing program.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a team and resource assessment involves a systematic process of auditing your resources, identifying your gaps, and creating a plan to address them.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple inventory of your content marketing resources. This should include a list of all the people on your team who are involved in content, a rough estimate of the number of hours they are spending on content each week, and a list of the content marketing tools you are currently using.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, your assessment should be more comprehensive. You should be creating a "skills matrix" for your content team to identify their strengths and weaknesses. You should also be doing a more detailed budget analysis to understand your "cost per piece of content." At this stage, you should also be creating a plan for how you will fill any resource gaps, whether that's through hiring, training, or outsourcing.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content capacity model." This is a spreadsheet that can help you to predict how much content you can create in a given period of time based on your available resources. This will help you to create a more realistic and achievable content calendar. You should also be regularly re-evaluating your resource plan to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving content strategy.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Assessment:** A small startup has one full-time content marketer who is a great writer but has limited design and video skills.
- **Plan:**
    - The content marketer will focus on writing blog posts and white papers.
    - They will hire a freelance graphic designer to create infographics and social media visuals.
    - They will use a simple, template-based video creation tool to create short product tutorials.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Assessment:** A mid-sized company has a marketing team with a mix of skills, but they lack the deep clinical expertise to create truly authoritative content.
- **Plan:**
    - They will create a "subject matter expert (SME)" program to get regular contributions from their internal clinical specialists.
    - They will build relationships with a few key opinion leaders (KOLs) in their industry to co-author articles and webinars.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Assessment:** A large company has a big marketing budget but a slow and bureaucratic content creation process.
- **Plan:**
    - They will implement a new project management tool and a more agile content workflow to speed up their production process.
    - They will empower their brand managers to create more of their own content, rather than relying on a centralized content team.

### What You'll Need
To conduct a team and resource assessment, you will need to have honest conversations with your team members about their skills, their workload, and their career goals. You will also need to work with your finance department to get a clear picture of your content marketing budget. Finally, you will need a good understanding of your content strategy and your goals to be able to identify your resource gaps.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and documented "resource plan" that outlines your current resources, your future needs, and your plan for filling the gaps. Another key indicator is an improvement in your team's morale and productivity. When your team members feel that they have the right skills, the right tools, and the right amount of time to do their jobs, they are much more likely to be engaged and effective. You should also see an improvement in the quality and the consistency of your content output.

### Time & Effort Estimate
- **Team Interviews and Skills Assessment:** 2-4 hours
- **Budget and Tool Analysis:** 1-2 hours
- **Resource Gap Analysis:** 1-2 hours
- **Resource Plan Development:** 2-4 hours
- **Total Time:** 6-12 hours

This is a strategic planning exercise that should be done on an annual basis, or whenever you are making a significant change to your content strategy or your business goals.
### Measuring Success
You'll know your team and resource assessment is successful when you see a significant improvement in the "velocity" of your content creation. This is a measure of how quickly you can take a content idea from concept to publication. As you build a more capable and efficient team, you should see your content velocity increase.

Another key success metric is the "employee retention rate" of your content team. A good resource plan should help you to create a work environment where your team members feel that they are being invested in, that they are learning and growing, and that they are doing meaningful work. This will make them more likely to stay with your company for the long term.

Ultimately, the clearest sign of success is when your content team becomes a "talent magnet" for your company. When the best and the brightest content marketers in your industry are lining up to come and work for you, you'll know that you have built a truly world-class content marketing program.

### Deep Dive
To take your team and resource assessment to the next level, create a "content marketing career path" for your team members. This is a document that outlines the different roles and responsibilities within your content team and the skills and experience that are required to move from one level to the next. This can be a powerful tool for attracting, retaining, and developing top talent.

You can also use your resource assessment as an opportunity to "insource" or "outsource" different parts of your content marketing program. For example, you might decide to bring your video production in-house to have more control over the quality, or you might decide to outsource your social media management to a specialized agency.

Finally, consider creating a "content marketing center of excellence" within your company. This is a cross-functional team that is responsible for setting the standards, for sharing the best practices, and for providing the training and the resources that are needed for everyone in the company to create high-quality, on-brand content.

### AI Collaboration
Your AI agent can be a valuable assistant in your team and resource assessment process, helping you to identify skills gaps, to find resources, and to create a plan for success. Here are three prompts to get you started:

1. **"Act as a marketing recruitment specialist. We are looking to hire a new '[Job Title]' for our content team. Based on the following job description: [Paste Job Description], write five insightful and challenging interview questions that we can ask to assess a candidate's skills and experience in [Specific Skill]."**
2. **"We have identified a skills gap on our team in the area of '[Skill].' Act as a professional development consultant. Research and recommend three different online courses, three books, and three industry experts that our team can learn from to improve their skills in this area."**
3. **"We are considering hiring a freelance '[Freelancer Role]' to help with our content creation. Act as a marketing manager. Write a detailed project brief for this freelancer that clearly outlines the scope of work, the deliverables, the timeline, and the budget for the first project."**

### Your Action Steps: An Expert Walkthrough
A great content strategy is nothing without a great team to execute it. We're going to take a hard, honest look at our team, our budget, and our tools to make sure that we have the resources we need to win. We're not just going to build a content plan; we're going to build a content *program* that is staffed for success.

First, I'm going to do a "talent review" of our entire content team. I'm going to have a one-on-one conversation with each team member about their skills, their passions, and their career goals. I'm going to use our "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1) to create a detailed skills matrix. Pro Tip: I always ask my team members to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 for each skill, and then I do my own rating. This can be a great way to start a productive conversation about their professional development.

Next, I'm going to do a deep dive into our content budget. I'm going to track every single dollar we are spending and I'm going to calculate our "cost per piece of content" and our "cost per lead." This will give us a clear understanding of the ROI of our content program. Finally, I'm going to take all of this information and I'm going to create our "Content Program Resource Plan." This will be our blueprint for how we are going to invest in our people, our tools, and our budget to build a world-class content marketing machine.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Assuming that you need a huge team to be successful.** Some of the most successful content marketing programs are run by very small teams. The key is to be strategic, to be efficient, and to focus on the things that will have the biggest impact.
- **Not investing in the professional development of your team.** The world of content marketing is constantly changing. You need to be investing in the training and the development of your team to ensure that they are always on the cutting edge.
- **Forgetting about your "soft" resources.** Your resources are not just your people and your budget. They are also your brand's reputation, your company's culture, and your relationships with your customers and your partners. Make sure you are leveraging all of these assets in your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for onboarding new team members or freelancers.** As you scale your content program, you will likely be bringing on new people. Make sure you have a clear and consistent process for onboarding them and for getting them up to speed on your strategy, your workflow, and your brand's voice.

# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic and honest evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, distribute, and measure the performance of your content. It is the process of taking a clear-eyed, realistic look at all of the resources you have at your disposal, including the skills and the available time of your people, the size and the allocation of your budget, and the capabilities of your technology stack. This is the critical reality check that ensures your content strategy is not just an ambitious and inspiring vision, but also a practical and achievable plan of action.

This is a holistic audit that should go far beyond a simple headcount of your marketing team. A comprehensive assessment should cover all of your potential content-related resources, including your internal team members and their specific skills, any external resources you may be using (such as freelance writers, designers, or agencies), and, just as importantly, your "hidden" or intangible content assets. These can include your library of existing content, the deep subject matter expertise of your in-house experts, your company's proprietary data and research, and your relationships with your customers and your industry partners.

By conducting this thorough and honest assessment, you can create a complete and multi-dimensional picture of your content program's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It is the foundational diagnostic process that allows you to identify any critical gaps in your team's skills, any significant bottlenecks in your production workflows, and any strategic areas where you may need to make a compelling business case for additional investment. It is the essential first step in building a truly sustainable, scalable, and successful content marketing program that is built on a solid foundation of reality.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy without a realistic and corresponding resource plan is nothing more than a well-intentioned wish list. It is easy to dream up a grand and ambitious content architecture, but if you do not have the people, the budget, and the tools to actually build and to maintain that architecture, your strategy is almost certainly doomed to fail. A rigorous and honest team and resource assessment is the essential and non-negotiable bridge that connects the grand vision of your strategy to the day-to-day reality of its execution. It is what makes your strategic goals achievable.

This systematic process is also your most powerful tool for making a clear, credible, and data-driven business case for the resources you need to be successful. It is not enough to simply ask for "more budget" or "another headcount." When you can walk into a leadership meeting with a detailed and objective assessment of your current capacity, a clear analysis of the specific gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, and a well-defined plan for how you will use any additional resources to drive a measurable business outcome, you are much more likely to get the investment and the support that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a comprehensive resource assessment can be a powerful catalyst for creativity and efficiency. By taking a complete inventory of all of your available assets, you will often discover "hidden" or underutilized resources that can be deployed to great effect. You might realize that your sales engineering team has a wealth of untapped subject matter expertise, that your product team is sitting on a goldmine of proprietary data that could be turned into a groundbreaking industry report, or that your customer success team has a direct line to a dozen happy customers who would be perfect for a case study. This process can help you to get significantly more done with the resources you already have and to maximize the return on investment of your entire content marketing program.

### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a team and resource assessment involves a systematic process of auditing your resources, identifying your gaps, and creating a plan to address them.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple inventory of your content marketing resources. This should include a list of all the people on your team who are involved in content, a rough estimate of the number of hours they are spending on content each week, and a list of the content marketing tools you are currently using.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, your assessment should be more comprehensive. You should be creating a "skills matrix" for your content team to identify their strengths and weaknesses. You should also be doing a more detailed budget analysis to understand your "cost per piece of content." At this stage, you should also be creating a plan for how you will fill any resource gaps, whether that's through hiring, training, or outsourcing.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content capacity model." This is a spreadsheet that can help you to predict how much content you can create in a given period of time based on your available resources. This will help you to create a more realistic and achievable content calendar. You should also be regularly re-evaluating your resource plan to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving content strategy.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Assessment:** A small startup has one full-time content marketer who is a great writer but has limited design and video skills.
- **Plan:**
    - The content marketer will focus on writing blog posts and white papers.
    - They will hire a freelance graphic designer to create infographics and social media visuals.
    - They will use a simple, template-based video creation tool to create short product tutorials.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Assessment:** A mid-sized company has a marketing team with a mix of skills, but they lack the deep clinical expertise to create truly authoritative content.
- **Plan:**
    - They will create a "subject matter expert (SME)" program to get regular contributions from their internal clinical specialists.
    - They will build relationships with a few key opinion leaders (KOLs) in their industry to co-author articles and webinars.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Assessment:** A large company has a big marketing budget but a slow and bureaucratic content creation process.
- **Plan:**
    - They will implement a new project management tool and a more agile content workflow to speed up their production process.
    - They will empower their brand managers to create more of their own content, rather than relying on a centralized content team.

### What You'll Need
To conduct a team and resource assessment, you will need to have honest conversations with your team members about their skills, their workload, and their career goals. You will also need to work with your finance department to get a clear picture of your content marketing budget. Finally, you will need a good understanding of your content strategy and your goals to be able to identify your resource gaps.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and documented "resource plan" that outlines your current resources, your future needs, and your plan for filling the gaps. Another key indicator is an improvement in your team's morale and productivity. When your team members feel that they have the right skills, the right tools, and the right amount of time to do their jobs, they are much more likely to be engaged and effective. You should also see an improvement in the quality and the consistency of your content output.
### The 'Why' Behind the 'How'
A content strategy without a realistic resource plan is just a wish list. A team and resource assessment is the essential and non-negotiable bridge that connects the grand vision of your strategy to the day-to-day reality of its execution. It's how you can create a content plan that is not just ambitious, but also achievable.

### Resource Spotlight
- **Tool:** "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1)
- **Further Reading:** "The E-Myth Revisited" by Michael E. Gerber. This book provides a powerful framework for thinking about how to build systems and to delegate work, which is a key part of scaling your content program.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Assuming that you need a huge team to be successful.** Some of the most successful content marketing programs are run by very small teams. The key is to be strategic, to be efficient, and to focus on the things that will have the biggest impact.
- **Not investing in the professional development of your team.** The world of content marketing is constantly changing. You need to be investing in the training and the development of your team to ensure that they are always on the cutting edge.
- **Forgetting about your "soft" resources.** Your resources are not just your people and your budget. They are also your brand's reputation, your company's culture, and your relationships with your customers and your partners. Make sure you are leveraging all of these assets in your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for onboarding new team members or freelancers.** As you scale your content program, you will likely be bringing on new people. Make sure you have a clear and consistent process for onboarding them and for getting them up to speed on your strategy, your workflow, and your brand's voice.

### Time & Effort Estimate
- **Team Interviews and Skills Assessment:** 2-4 hours
- **Budget and Tool Analysis:** 1-2 hours
- **Resource Gap Analysis:** 1-2 hours
- **Resource Plan Development:** 2-4 hours
- **Total Time:** 6-12 hours

This is a strategic planning exercise that should be done on an annual basis, or whenever you are making a significant change to your content strategy or your business goals.

> **Note for CMOs and Team Leads:** This assessment is the foundation of your strategic plan. The outputs of this exercise will determine the scope and the ambition of your content roadmap. Be honest and realistic in your assessment, and be prepared to make a strong business case for the resources you need to be successful.
### Measuring Success
You'll know your team and resource assessment is successful when you see a significant improvement in the "velocity" of your content creation. This is a measure of how quickly you can take a content idea from concept to publication. As you build a more capable and efficient team, you should see your content velocity increase.

Another key success metric is the "employee retention rate" of your content team. A good resource plan should help you to create a work environment where your team members feel that they are being invested in, that they are learning and growing, and that they are doing meaningful work. This will make them more likely to stay with your company for the long term.

Ultimately, the clearest sign of success is when your content team becomes a "talent magnet" for your company. When the best and the brightest content marketers in your industry are lining up to come and work for you, you'll know that you have built a truly world-class content marketing program.

> **Perspective for Solo Consultants:** As a solo consultant, you are the team. This assessment is about being honest with yourself about your own strengths and weaknesses. Where do you excel? Where do you need help? This will help you to decide what to focus on, what to learn, and what to outsource.

### Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Problem:** You are struggling to get the budget you need to execute your content strategy.
  - **Solution:** You are likely not speaking the language of the business. You need to frame your budget request in terms of "investment" and "return," not "cost" and "expense." Create a simple ROI model that shows how your content marketing program will drive a measurable business outcome (e.g., leads, sales, revenue). This will make it much easier to get the buy-in you need.

- **Problem:** Your content team is burnt out and unmotivated.
  - **Solution:** You have a "capacity" problem. Your team is likely being asked to do too much with too little. You need to go back to your "Minimum Viable vs. Comprehensive Architecture" (Section 21) and have an honest conversation about what is realistic. It's better to do a great job on a few things than a mediocre job on a lot of things.

- **Problem:** You are struggling to find and to retain top content marketing talent.
  - **Solution:** You need to invest in your "employer brand." The best content marketers want to work for companies that are doing interesting, creative, and strategic work. They want to be part of a team where they can learn, grow, and make an impact. You need to create a culture and an environment that is a "talent magnet" for the best and the brightest.

### Deep Dive
To take your team and resource assessment to the next level, create a "content marketing career path" for your team members. This is a document that outlines the different roles and responsibilities within your content team and the skills and experience that are required to move from one level to the next. This can be a powerful tool for attracting, retaining, and developing top talent. This is a key part of **committing to assist and prevent recurrence** of skills gaps on your team.

You can also use your resource assessment as an opportunity to "insource" or "outsource" different parts of your content marketing program. For example, you might decide to bring your video production in-house to have more control over the quality, or you might decide to outsource your social media management to a specialized agency. This is a strategic decision that should be based on a clear-eyed assessment of your team's skills and your company's priorities. This is a form of **selective presentation of your point of view**, choosing to own the channels where your voice is strongest.

Finally, consider creating a "content marketing center of excellence" within your company. This is a cross-functional team that is responsible for setting the standards, for sharing the best practices, and for providing the training and the resources that are needed for everyone in the company to create high-quality, on-brand content. This is a powerful way to **cement the narrative internally** and to ensure that your brand's voice is consistent across all channels.

### AI Collaboration
Your AI agent can be a valuable assistant in your team and resource assessment process, helping you to identify skills gaps, to find resources, and to create a plan for success. Here are three prompts to get you started:

1. **"Act as a marketing recruitment specialist. We are looking to hire a new '[Job Title]' for our content team. Based on the following job description: [Paste Job Description], write five insightful and challenging interview questions that we can ask to assess a candidate's skills and experience in [Specific Skill]."**
2. **"We have identified a skills gap on our team in the area of '[Skill].' Act as a professional development consultant. Research and recommend three different online courses, three books, and three industry experts that our team can learn from to improve their skills in this area."**
3. **"We are considering hiring a freelance '[Freelancer Role]' to help with our content creation. Act as a marketing manager. Write a detailed project brief for this freelancer that clearly outlines the scope of work, the deliverables, the timeline, and the budget for the first project."**

### Connecting to the Bigger Picture
Your team and resource assessment is the "reality check" for your entire content architecture. It is the critical input for your decision between a Minimum Viable vs. Comprehensive Architecture (Section 21). You cannot create a realistic and an achievable roadmap without a clear and an honest understanding of your available resources. It is also a key part of your Content Production Workflows (Section 22), as your workflow needs to be designed to make the most of your team's unique skills and to work around their limitations. A good resource plan is not just about getting more budget; it is about being a good steward of the resources you already have.

### Your Action Steps: An Expert Walkthrough
A great content strategy is nothing without a great team to execute it. We're going to take a hard, honest look at our team, our budget, and our tools to make sure that we have the resources we need to win. We're not just going to build a content plan; we're going to build a content *program* that is staffed for success.

First, I'm going to do a "talent review" of our entire content team. I'm going to have a one-on-one conversation with each team member about their skills, their passions, and their career goals. I'm going to use our "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1) to create a detailed skills matrix.
> **Pro Tip:** I always ask my team members to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 for each skill, and then I do my own rating. This can be a great way to start a productive conversation about their professional development and to identify areas where they might be underestimating their own abilities.

Next, I'm going to do a deep dive into our content budget. I'm going to track every single dollar we are spending and I'm going to calculate our "cost per piece of content" and our "cost per lead." This will give us a clear understanding of the ROI of our content program. Finally, I'm going to take all of this information and I'm going to create our "Content Program Resource Plan." This will be our blueprint for how we are going to invest in our people, our tools, and our budget to build a world-class content marketing machine.

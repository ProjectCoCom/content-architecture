# 11. Stakeholder-Focused Content

### What This Is
Stakeholder-focused content is tailored to the specific roles, responsibilities, and motivations of the different people involved in a buying decision. While industry-focused content adapts to the "where," stakeholder-focused content adapts to the "who." It recognizes that a CFO, an IT manager, and a daily user all have different questions and priorities, even when they work at the same company.

### Why This Matters
In most B2B sales (and even many complex B2C sales), the buying decision is made by a committee, not an individual. If your content only speaks to one person in that group, you're leaving the others unpersuaded. By creating content for each stakeholder, you equip your internal champion to make the case to their colleagues, addressing every concern and building consensus around your solution.

### Your Action Step
Map out the three to five core stakeholders in your buying committee and brainstorm three to five content ideas for each.

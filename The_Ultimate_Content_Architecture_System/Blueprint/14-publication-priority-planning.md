# 14. Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish first to achieve maximum impact with limited resources. It involves sequencing your content production based on a combination of factors, including SEO opportunity, audience needs, and business goals.

### Why This Matters
You can't publish your entire content architecture at once. A strategic publishing plan ensures that the first pieces of content you create start building authority and momentum immediately. A "random acts of content" approach leads to slow growth and wasted effort. Prioritization allows you to build your content empire brick by brick in the most logical and effective order.

### Your Action Step
Create a three-month content roadmap that prioritizes the publication of your first pillar, its core cluster articles, and a handful of quick-win supporting articles.

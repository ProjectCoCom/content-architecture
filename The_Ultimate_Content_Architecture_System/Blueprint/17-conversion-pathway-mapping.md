# 17. Conversion Pathway Mapping

### What This Is
Conversion pathway mapping is the process of strategically designing and placing calls-to-action (CTAs) within your content to guide users from being passive readers to active leads or customers. It's about intentionally creating journeys that align with the user's intent and position your product or service as the logical next step.

### Why This Matters
Content without a conversion pathway is a dead end. You might attract a huge audience, but if you don't provide a clear next step, you'll fail to generate any business value. A well-designed conversion pathway turns your content from a cost center into a revenue driver, ensuring your authority-building efforts translate into tangible business results.

### Your Action Step
Define one primary call-to-action for each stage of your content funnel (Top, Middle, and Bottom) and map them to your content tiers.

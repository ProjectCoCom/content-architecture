# 6. Pillar Content Strategy

### What This Is
Pillar content represents your most comprehensive, authoritative content pieces. These are the cornerstone articles that demonstrate your expertise, target your most important keywords, and serve as the hub for entire topic clusters. Think of pillars as your content's skyscrapers—the most visible, substantial structures in your content city.

### Why This Matters
Pillar content establishes your authority in Google's eyes and your audience's minds. A well-crafted pillar page can rank for dozens of related keywords, generate backlinks naturally, and serve as the foundation for hundreds of supporting articles. Without strong pillars, your content architecture lacks structural integrity.

### Your Action Step
Outline your first pillar page with a detailed structure of 8-15 sections, ensuring it comprehensively covers your core topic at a high level.

# 24. Using the Facebook Community

### What This Is
The private Facebook community is an exclusive resource for Intermediate and Pro Tier users of The Ultimate Content Architecture System. It's a space to connect with fellow content strategists, marketers, and business owners who are also working to build their content authority.

### Why This Matters
Building a content architecture can be a complex and challenging process. The community provides a support system where you can:
-   Ask questions and get advice from peers and experts.
-   Share your wins and get feedback on your work.
-   Stay motivated and accountable to your goals.
-   Network with other smart, ambitious content professionals.

### Your Action Step
Join the private Facebook community and draft an introduction post sharing who you are, what you're working on, and one specific question you have.

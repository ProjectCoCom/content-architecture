# 18. Metrics & Success Criteria

### What This Is
Metrics and success criteria are the specific, measurable indicators you use to determine if your content architecture is achieving its goals. It's the process of moving beyond vanity metrics (like page views) to focus on the data that truly reflects business impact.

### Why This Matters
If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Without clear success criteria, you're flying blind, unable to distinguish between content that's working and content that's wasting resources. A solid metrics framework allows you to prove the ROI of your content efforts, make data-driven decisions, and continuously optimize your strategy for better results.

### Your Action Step
Establish your baseline by documenting your core traffic, engagement, and conversion metrics, then set realistic improvement goals for the next quarter.

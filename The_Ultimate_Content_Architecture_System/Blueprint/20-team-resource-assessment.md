# 20. Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
Team and resource assessment is the process of evaluating your internal and external capabilities to execute your content architecture plan. It involves honestly answering the questions: "Who is going to do all this work?" and "What do we need to be successful?" This includes assessing skills, time, budget, and tools.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy is useless without the resources to execute it. A realistic assessment of your capabilities prevents you from creating a plan that's dead on arrival. It helps you make smart decisions about what to do in-house, what to outsource, where to invest in training, and what tools to purchase, ensuring your ambition is matched by your ability to deliver.

### Your Action Step
Perform a skills inventory of your team to identify your biggest content gaps and create a hiring or training plan to fill them.

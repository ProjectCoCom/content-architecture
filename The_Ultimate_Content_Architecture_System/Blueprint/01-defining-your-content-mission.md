# 1. Defining Your Content Mission

### What This Is
Your content mission is the foundational statement that defines why your content exists, who it serves, and what transformation it provides. This isn't a tagline or marketing copy—it's your strategic north star that guides every content decision you make.

### Why This Matters
Without a clear content mission, you'll create random articles that don't build authority or business value. Your mission ensures every piece of content you create ladders up to a larger strategic goal. It helps you say "no" to content ideas that don't serve your purpose and "yes" to ones that do.

### Your Action Step
Draft a one-sentence content mission statement that answers what problems you solve, who you solve them for, and what outcome your readers will achieve.

# 16. SEO & Keyword Strategy

### What This Is
SEO and keyword strategy is the foundational layer of your entire content architecture. It's the practice of understanding what your audience is searching for and strategically targeting those queries to drive relevant organic traffic. It's not about "tricking" Google; it's about aligning your content with user intent.

### Why This Matters
Without a solid SEO and keyword strategy, your content is a ship without a rudder. You might create the best content in the world, but if no one can find it, it won't deliver business results. A smart SEO strategy ensures that every piece of content you create has a built-in audience, connecting you with potential customers at the exact moment they are looking for a solution.

### Your Action Step
Map a primary keyword to your first pillar page and each of its associated cluster articles, along with three to five secondary keywords for each.

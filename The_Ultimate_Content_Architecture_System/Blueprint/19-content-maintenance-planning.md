# 19. Content Maintenance Planning

### What This Is
Content maintenance planning, also known as content auditing or content decay analysis, is the process of systematically reviewing, updating, and improving your existing content to keep it accurate, relevant, and performing at its peak. It's the practice of treating your content as a living library, not a "publish and forget" archive.

### Why This Matters
Content has a shelf life. Statistics become outdated, best practices evolve, and what was once a top-ranking article can slowly lose its position to fresher content—a phenomenon known as "content decay." A maintenance plan protects your investment, ensuring your content continues to generate traffic and leads long after it's published. Often, updating an old post can deliver results much faster than creating a new one from scratch.

### Your Action Step
Perform a quick refresh on one of your top-performing articles by updating statistics, adding new insights, and improving internal links.

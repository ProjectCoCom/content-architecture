# 4. Core Topic & Authority Selection

### What This Is
Core topic and authority selection is the strategic decision about what specific subject matter your content will own. This isn't your general industry—it's the specific angle, perspective, methodology, or sub-topic where you'll become THE definitive voice. It's the intersection of your expertise, audience needs, and market opportunity.

### Why This Matters
You can't be an authority on everything. Brands that try to cover their entire industry superficially never become known for anything. The paradox of content authority is that the narrower and deeper you go initially, the broader your influence becomes over time. Master one thing first, then expand.

### Your Action Step
Select one to two core topics where you can become the definitive authority by evaluating your expertise, audience demand, and competitive opportunity.

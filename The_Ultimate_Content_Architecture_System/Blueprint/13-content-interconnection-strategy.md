# 13. Content Interconnection Strategy

### What This Is
A content interconnection strategy is the deliberate practice of linking your content pieces together to guide users on a logical journey and to signal topical authority to search engines. It's the "architecture" part of content architecture, transforming standalone articles into a cohesive, navigable ecosystem. The primary model for this is the "Hub and Spoke" model, where pillars act as hubs and clusters/supporting content act as spokes.

### Why This Matters
Without a clear linking strategy, you have a collection of disconnected pages, not a content authority site. Interlinking is crucial for:
-   **User Experience**: It helps readers discover more of your relevant content, keeping them engaged longer.
-   **SEO**: It distributes "link equity" (ranking power) throughout your site, helping more of your pages rank higher.
-   **Topical Authority**: A dense web of internal links around a specific topic tells Google that you have deep expertise in that area.

### Your Action Step
Map out your hub-and-spoke linking structure for your first pillar and cluster, defining the primary links between them.

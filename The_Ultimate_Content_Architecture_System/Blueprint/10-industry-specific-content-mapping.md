# 10. Industry-Specific Content Mapping

### What This Is
Industry-specific content mapping is the process of adapting your core content architecture to the unique language, challenges, regulations, and use cases of a specific vertical. It involves creating dedicated content that speaks directly to the needs of your target industries, demonstrating that you don't just understand your topic in general, but you understand it in their world.

### Why This Matters
Authority is built on relevance. A healthcare administrator doesn't care about a generic project management solution; they care about a HIPAA-compliant solution that can manage patient workflows. By creating industry-specific content, you dramatically increase your relevance, build deeper trust, and can often command higher prices for your products or services. This is how you move from being a generalist to a sought-after specialist.

### Your Action Step
Prioritize your top two to three target industries and outline a comprehensive "industry hub" page for one of them.

# 8. Supporting Content Network

### What This Is
The supporting content network is the third tier of your architecture. These pieces of content are even more specific than your cluster articles. They answer granular questions, define key terms, provide specific examples, or compare tools and tactics. This is where you build a comprehensive library of resources that addresses virtually every question your audience might have about your core topic.

### Why This Matters
Supporting content is the key to achieving true topical dominance. It captures a high volume of long-tail keyword traffic, satisfies very specific user intent, and provides immense value to readers who need a quick, direct answer to a single question. This network of content also creates a dense web of internal links that boosts the SEO authority of your pillar and cluster pages.

### Your Action Step
For one cluster article, brainstorm and prioritize three to five specific supporting article ideas that answer granular questions a reader might have.

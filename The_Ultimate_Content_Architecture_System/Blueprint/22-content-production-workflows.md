# 22. Content Production Workflows

### What This Is
A content production workflow is a standardized, repeatable process that takes a content idea from conception to publication and beyond. It defines the specific steps, tools, and people involved in creating, reviewing, publishing, and promoting every piece of content.

### Why This Matters
Without a defined workflow, content creation is chaotic, inefficient, and stressful. Deadlines get missed, quality is inconsistent, and steps get skipped. A clear workflow turns your content strategy into a well-oiled machine, allowing you to produce high-quality content consistently and at scale, with less stress and fewer errors.

### Your Action Step
Design and document a simple, 7-step content production workflow and set up a Trello board to track your content's progress through each stage.

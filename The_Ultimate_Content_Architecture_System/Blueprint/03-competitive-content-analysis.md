# 3. Competitive Content Analysis

### What This Is
Competitive content analysis is the systematic evaluation of what content exists in your market, who's creating it, what's working (and what's not), and most importantly, where the gaps and opportunities exist for your brand to establish differentiated authority.

### Why This Matters
You can't build market-leading content by copying competitors. But you also can't ignore what already exists. This analysis helps you find white space opportunities, avoid oversaturated topics, understand baseline quality expectations, and identify weaknesses in competitor approaches that you can exploit.

### Your Action Step
Analyze five to ten competitors to identify three to five topics they are not covering that you can own.

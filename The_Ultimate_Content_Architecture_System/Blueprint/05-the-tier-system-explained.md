# 5. The Tier System Explained

### What This Is
The tier system is a hierarchical content organization method that structures your content from broad, foundational pieces (pillars) down to highly specific, targeted pages (longtail). Each tier serves a different strategic purpose, targets different audience awareness stages, and supports different business goals. Together, they create a comprehensive content ecosystem.

### Why This Matters
Without a tier system, you create random content with no strategic relationships. The tier system ensures every piece of content has a purpose and place in your broader authority-building strategy. It creates clear pathways for readers to go deeper, helps you identify content gaps, and gives you a blueprint for scaling systematically.

### Your Action Step
Outline your content structure with two to three pillar ideas, five to eight major subtopics for your first pillar, and five to ten supporting article ideas for each subtopic.

# 14. Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish first to achieve maximum impact with limited resources. It involves sequencing your content production based on a combination of factors, including SEO opportunity, audience needs, and business goals.

### Why This Matters
You can't publish your entire content architecture at once. A strategic publishing plan ensures that the first pieces of content you create start building authority and momentum immediately. A "random acts of content" approach leads to slow growth and wasted effort. Prioritization allows you to build your content empire brick by brick in the most logical and effective order.

### Your Action Steps
Your immediate action is to create a focused three-month content roadmap using the "Publication Priority Planner" template. For the first month, you will schedule the publication of your primary pillar page and its two or three most critical cluster articles. In the second month, you will plan to publish the remaining cluster articles for that pillar, along with three to five "quick win" supporting articles. For the third month, your focus will be on building out the next layer of supporting content and outlining your second pillar page. This phased approach ensures you are building your architecture systematically.

Next, you must identify the "quick win" keywords that will provide short-term traffic and momentum while your larger pillar content gains authority. Using an SEO tool, you will search for keywords related to your core topic that have a respectable search volume but low keyword difficulty. These are often long-tail or question-based phrases. Your task is to identify 5 to 10 of these topics and schedule them for publication within your first few months, ensuring you have a steady stream of traffic from the outset.

Finally, you need to define a realistic and sustainable publishing cadence. Based on a clear-eyed assessment of your team's resources—including writers, budget, and available time—you must determine how frequently you can publish new content. Whether it's one, two, or four articles per week, the key is consistency. Document this cadence in your planner and stick to it, as a reliable publishing schedule is more effective in the long run than sporadic bursts of high volume.

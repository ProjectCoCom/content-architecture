# 13. Content Interconnection Strategy

### What This Is
A content interconnection strategy is the deliberate practice of linking your content pieces together to guide users on a logical journey and to signal topical authority to search engines. It's the "architecture" part of content architecture, transforming standalone articles into a cohesive, navigable ecosystem. The primary model for this is the "Hub and Spoke" model, where pillars act as hubs and clusters/supporting content act as spokes.

### Why This Matters
Without a clear linking strategy, you have a collection of disconnected pages, not a content authority site. Interlinking is crucial for:
-   **User Experience**: It helps readers discover more of your relevant content, keeping them engaged longer.
-   **SEO**: It distributes "link equity" (ranking power) throughout your site, helping more of your pages rank higher.
-   **Topical Authority**: A dense web of internal links around a specific topic tells Google that you have deep expertise in that area.

### Your Action Steps
Your first action is to explicitly map out the primary links within your hub-and-spoke model. Using the "Interlinking Strategy Worksheet" and the content outlines you've already created, you will define the connections between your first pillar and its core cluster articles. For each section of your pillar outline, you need to list the specific cluster article you will link to. Conversely, in each cluster outline, you must specify the exact anchor text you will use to link back to the pillar. This ensures that the foundational connections of your architecture are established from the very beginning.

Next, you will identify opportunities for "spoke-to-spoke" linking to create a denser network of related content. Review the list of articles within a single content cluster and identify pairs or groups that are closely related. For each article, your task is to list two or three other articles within the same cluster that it should link to. This practice creates a seamless journey for readers who want to go deep on a specific topic and signals a strong thematic relationship to search engines.

Finally, you should perform a quick audit to find and integrate any "orphan" pages on your existing site. These are pages that have few or no internal links pointing to them, making them difficult for both users and search engines to find. A simple `site:yourwebsite.com "keyword"` search on Google can help you identify pages that aren't ranking as expected. Your action is to create a list of these stranded pages and develop a plan to link to them from relevant articles within your new content architecture, ensuring every page has a clear path to discovery.

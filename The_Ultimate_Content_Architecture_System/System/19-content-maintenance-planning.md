# 19. Content Maintenance Planning

### What This Is
Content maintenance planning, also known as content auditing or content decay analysis, is the process of systematically reviewing, updating, and improving your existing content to keep it accurate, relevant, and performing at its peak. It's the practice of treating your content as a living library, not a "publish and forget" archive.

### Why This Matters
Content has a shelf life. Statistics become outdated, best practices evolve, and what was once a top-ranking article can slowly lose its position to fresher content—a phenomenon known as "content decay." A maintenance plan protects your investment, ensuring your content continues to generate traffic and leads long after it's published. Often, updating an old post can deliver results much faster than creating a new one from scratch.

### Your Action Steps
Your first step is to identify your highest-value content assets that are ripe for an update. Using Google Analytics, you will find your top 10 most-viewed pages from the last 6-12 months and list them in the "Content Maintenance Plan Worksheet." This data-driven approach ensures you are focusing your initial maintenance efforts on the content that has the greatest potential to impact your overall performance.

Next, you will perform a quick but impactful "refresh" on one of the top-performing articles you've identified. Your task is to read through the article and find at least three to five specific areas for improvement, such as updating an outdated statistic, adding a new example, incorporating a better visual, or adding internal links to newer, relevant content. After making these changes, you will update the publication date to signal its freshness to search engines and your audience.

Finally, to ensure that content maintenance becomes an integral part of your strategy, you must schedule your first quarterly content review. By putting a recurring "Quarterly Content Review" event on your calendar three months from now, you are committing to a regular cadence of auditing and improving your content. This simple but crucial step transforms content maintenance from a reactive, one-off task into a proactive, systematic process that will protect and enhance the value of your content assets over time.

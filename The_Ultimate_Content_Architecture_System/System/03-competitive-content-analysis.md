# 3. Competitive Content Analysis

### What This Is
Competitive content analysis is the systematic evaluation of what content exists in your market, who's creating it, what's working (and what's not), and most importantly, where the gaps and opportunities exist for your brand to establish differentiated authority.

### Why This Matters
You can't build market-leading content by copying competitors. But you also can't ignore what already exists. This analysis helps you find white space opportunities, avoid oversaturated topics, understand baseline quality expectations, and identify weaknesses in competitor approaches that you can exploit.

### Your Action Steps
Begin by identifying your competitive set. Using the "Competitive Content Analysis Worksheet," compile a list of 8-10 key competitors or publishers in your space. This list should not be limited to direct business competitors but should also include influential content publishers and leaders in adjacent industries. This broad view will give you a more complete picture of the content landscape your audience is engaging with.

Next, conduct a thorough audit of the topics your competitors are covering. For each competitor, review their blog, resource centers, and guides, and document your findings in a spreadsheet. You should track the major topics they cover, the types of content they produce for each topic, a quality rating on a scale of 1-5, and any signals of audience engagement you can find. This systematic audit will help you understand their content strategy and identify the baseline for quality in your market.

With your audit complete, your final step is to identify the content gaps and opportunities. Analyze your spreadsheet to find patterns, such as topics that are not being covered by anyone, areas where the existing content quality is universally low, or audience segments that are being underserved. Combine this with a basic SEO analysis using a tool like Ahrefs or SEMrush to find high-volume keywords that your competitors are not effectively targeting. This process will yield a list of 10-15 clear opportunity areas for you to build your content strategy around.

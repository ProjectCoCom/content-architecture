# 11. Stakeholder-Focused Content

### What This Is
Stakeholder-focused content is tailored to the specific roles, responsibilities, and motivations of the different people involved in a buying decision. While industry-focused content adapts to the "where," stakeholder-focused content adapts to the "who." It recognizes that a CFO, an IT manager, and a daily user all have different questions and priorities, even when they work at the same company.

### Why This Matters
In most B2B sales (and even many complex B2C sales), the buying decision is made by a committee, not an individual. If your content only speaks to one person in that group, you're leaving the others unpersuaded. By creating content for each stakeholder, you equip your internal champion to make the case to their colleagues, addressing every concern and building consensus around your solution.

### Your Action Steps
Your first task is to map out the key players involved in a typical buying decision for your product or service. Using the "Stakeholder Content Planning Worksheet," you will list every job title that has a voice in the process, from the initial researcher to the final economic buyer. Once you have this list, you will group these titles into three to five core stakeholder personas, such as the "Technical Buyer" or the "User Buyer," which will allow you to create content that is tailored to the distinct motivations of each group.

Next, you must develop a deep understanding of each stakeholder persona. For each one you've defined, you will create a detailed profile that documents their primary professional goal, their biggest concern or fear related to your solution, the key metrics they use to measure success, and the single most important question they need answered. This profiling exercise is critical for moving beyond generic content and creating materials that speak directly to the unique and often competing priorities within the buying committee.

With your stakeholder profiles complete, your final step is to brainstorm a set of targeted content ideas for each persona. For each stakeholder, generate three to five compelling article titles that directly address their specific goals, concerns, and questions. For example, for a CFO persona, a title like "Beyond the Sticker Price: Calculating the True ROI of [Your Product]" would be far more effective than a generic feature overview. This process ensures that your content plan includes specific assets designed to persuade every member of the buying committee, shortening your sales cycle and empowering your internal champions.

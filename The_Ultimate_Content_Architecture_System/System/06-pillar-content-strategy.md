# 6. Pillar Content Strategy

### What This Is
Pillar content represents your most comprehensive, authoritative content pieces. These are the cornerstone articles that demonstrate your expertise, target your most important keywords, and serve as the hub for entire topic clusters. Think of pillars as your content's skyscrapers—the most visible, substantial structures in your content city.

### Why This Matters
Pillar content establishes your authority in Google's eyes and your audience's minds. A well-crafted pillar page can rank for dozens of related keywords, generate backlinks naturally, and serve as the foundation for hundreds of supporting articles. Without strong pillars, your content architecture lacks structural integrity.

### Your Action Steps
Your first and most critical action is to create a detailed outline for your first pillar page. Using the "Pillar Page Content Brief," you will choose one of your pillar ideas and define its target audience and primary keyword. You will then build out a comprehensive structure with 8 to 15 distinct sections, ensuring that the outline covers the core topic exhaustively. For each section, you must list the key questions it will answer and identify the corresponding cluster topics you will eventually link to, creating a complete blueprint for your cornerstone content.

Once the outline is complete, your next step is to gather the essential resources needed to create the pillar content. This involves a thorough review of all existing internal assets, such as data, research, or previous articles, that can be repurposed or referenced. In addition to internal resources, you should identify and list 5 to 10 external authoritative sources that can be cited to bolster your content's credibility. This phase also includes brainstorming 3 to 5 ideas for unique visual elements, such as diagrams or charts, that will help make the complex information more digestible and engaging for the reader.

With your structure and resources in place, you can begin the writing process by drafting the introduction and creating the table of contents. The introduction is crucial for hooking the reader and setting clear expectations for what they will learn. Following that, build out the table of contents with jump links, which serves as the organizational skeleton of your pillar page. This initial writing phase establishes the foundation of the article and makes the subsequent task of filling in the content for each section much more manageable.

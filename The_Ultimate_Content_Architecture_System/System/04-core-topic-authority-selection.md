# 4. Core Topic & Authority Selection

### What This Is
Core topic and authority selection is the strategic decision about what specific subject matter your content will own. This isn't your general industry—it's the specific angle, perspective, methodology, or sub-topic where you'll become THE definitive voice. It's the intersection of your expertise, audience needs, and market opportunity.

### Why This Matters
You can't be an authority on everything. Brands that try to cover their entire industry superficially never become known for anything. The paradox of content authority is that the narrower and deeper you go initially, the broader your influence becomes over time. Master one thing first, then expand.

### Your Action Steps
Your first action is to brainstorm a wide range of potential core topic options. Open the "Core Topic Selection Worksheet" and list ten to fifteen possibilities where you could potentially build authority. At this stage, do not filter your ideas; focus on generating a diverse list of possibilities.

Next, you will systematically evaluate each of these potential topics against a set of five key criteria. For each topic, you will score it on a scale of one to five for your level of expertise, the existing audience demand, its alignment with your business goals, the competitive landscape, and your team's passion for the subject. This data driven approach is designed to remove guesswork and emotion from the decision, allowing you to make a more objective and strategic choice.

After scoring all of your options, your final step is to select your primary core topic and begin to define your proprietary framework around it. Choose your highest scoring topic and write a clear positioning statement that articulates what you will be an authority on and why it matters to your audience. Then, you will give your unique approach a name and outline its core principles.

### Strategic Insight
The selection of a core topic is as much about what you say "no" to as what you say "yes" to. By choosing to focus on "Async-First Project Management," for example, you are also implicitly choosing *not* to focus on "Agile methodology for large enterprises." This act of strategic exclusion is what creates clarity and focus for your brand. A great core topic is a filter that not only guides your content creation but also helps you build a distinct and memorable brand identity in a crowded market.

### Common Mistakes During This Step
- **Choosing a topic based on passion alone.** While passion is an important ingredient, it is not enough. A successful core topic must also have a clear connection to your business goals and a real demand from your target audience. A topic that you are passionate about but that no one is searching for is a hobby, not a content strategy.
- **Being afraid to be niche.** Many brands make the mistake of choosing a topic that is too broad because they are afraid of limiting their potential audience. The reality is that a narrow and deep focus is the fastest path to building a loyal and engaged audience. You can always expand your focus later, after you have established a strong foundation of authority.
- **Forgetting to create a proprietary framework.** Simply choosing a core topic is not enough. You must also develop a unique perspective or methodology that is your own. This is what will make your content stand out and what will ultimately make your brand a recognized authority. Without a unique framework, you are just another commodity content creator.

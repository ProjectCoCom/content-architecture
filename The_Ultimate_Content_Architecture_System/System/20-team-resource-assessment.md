# 20. Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
Team and resource assessment is the process of evaluating your internal and external capabilities to execute your content architecture plan. It involves honestly answering the questions: "Who is going to do all this work?" and "What do we need to be successful?" This includes assessing skills, time, budget, and tools.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy is useless without the resources to execute it. A realistic assessment of your capabilities prevents you from creating a plan that's dead on arrival. It helps you make smart decisions about what to do in-house, what to outsource, where to invest in training, and what tools to purchase, ensuring your ambition is matched by your ability to deliver.

### Your Action Steps
Your first action is to conduct a candid skills inventory of your current team. Using the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet," you will list the essential content skills—Writing, Editing, SEO, Design, and Strategy—and rate your team's proficiency in each area on a scale of 1 to 5. This honest assessment will immediately highlight your most significant gaps and provide a clear picture of the capabilities you have in-house versus what you may need to acquire through training or hiring.

Next, you must create a realistic estimate of the time commitment your content plan requires. Review your three-month content roadmap and calculate the approximate number of hours needed to produce a single piece of content, from research and writing to design and promotion. By multiplying this estimate by your desired publishing cadence, you will arrive at a weekly time commitment that you can compare against your team's available capacity, forcing a practical conversation about the feasibility of your plan.

Based on your identified skill gaps and time constraints, your final step is to create a "first hire" plan. You will decide which role is most critical to your immediate success—whether it's a freelance writer to increase output, an SEO consultant for strategic guidance, or a virtual assistant for administrative tasks. To make this plan actionable, you will write a concise, one-paragraph job description for this role, which will serve as the first step in securing the resources needed to execute your content strategy effectively.

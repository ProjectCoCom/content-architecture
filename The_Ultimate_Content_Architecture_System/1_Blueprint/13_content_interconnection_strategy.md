# Content Interconnection Strategy

### What This Is
A content interconnection strategy is the practice of creating a dense and logical network of internal links between your content assets. It's about intentionally building pathways that guide your audience and search engines through your content library, from one related piece to another. This strategy transforms your collection of individual articles into a cohesive, interconnected ecosystem of knowledge.

This is more than just dropping a few "related post" links at the bottom of your articles. It's a strategic approach to link building that considers the relationship between your different pieces of content and the journey that you want your audience to take. It involves linking from your cluster content up to your pillar pages, between related cluster pieces, and from your broader content out to your more specific, longtail content.

By being deliberate about your internal linking, you create a "web" of content that is greater than the sum of its parts. You increase the discoverability of your content, you improve the user experience, and you signal the topical authority of your website to search engines. It's a foundational element of a sophisticated content architecture.

### Why This Matters
A strong internal linking strategy is crucial for SEO. It helps search engines to understand the structure of your website, the relationship between your different pieces of content, and the relative importance of your pages. It also helps to distribute "link equity" (or "link juice") throughout your site, which can help to improve the rankings of all of your content. A well-linked piece of content is more likely to be crawled, indexed, and ranked by search engines.

This is also incredibly important for your audience. A thoughtful internal linking strategy creates a seamless and intuitive user experience. It helps your audience to discover more of your relevant content, to go deeper on the topics they are interested in, and to get a more complete and satisfying answer to their questions. This can lead to a significant increase in user engagement, with higher time on page, more pages per session, and a lower bounce rate.

Finally, a content interconnection strategy is a powerful way to guide your audience through your marketing and sales funnel. By strategically linking your top-of-funnel content to your middle-of-funnel content, and your middle-of-funnel content to your bottom-of-funnel content, you can create a clear and compelling journey that moves your audience from awareness to consideration to conversion.



### Your Action Steps
Take your most recently published article. Read through it and find three places where you could naturally add a link to another relevant article on your website. Then, find one older article on your site and add a link from it to your new article. This simple "give and take" of internal linking is a great habit to build and will help to make your entire content library more connected and more valuable.

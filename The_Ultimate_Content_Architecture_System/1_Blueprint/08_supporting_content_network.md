# Supporting Content Network

### What This Is
A supporting content network is the collection of all your other content assets that do not fit neatly into the pillar-and-cluster model but still play a crucial role in your overall content strategy. This includes a wide variety of content types, such as case studies, expert interviews, news analysis, company announcements, and "behind-the-scenes" cultural content. These pieces of content help to add depth, personality, and timeliness to your brand's voice, creating a more well-rounded and engaging content experience.

This is the content that makes your brand human and transforms it from a simple resource into a relatable and trustworthy entity. While your pillar and cluster content is focused on building deep, educational authority on your core topics, your supporting content network is focused on building relationships, demonstrating relevance, and providing social proof. It is where you can share your company's unique perspective, celebrate your customers' successes, and engage with the current conversations happening in your industry.

By intentionally cultivating this network of supporting content, you create a more holistic and engaging content experience for your audience. You show them that you are not just a machine for producing educational content, but a vibrant and active participant in their world. This is a key part of building a brand that people not only trust for its expertise, but also like and want to connect with on a more personal level. It is the connective tissue that holds your entire content architecture together.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy that consists only of evergreen, educational content can often feel sterile and impersonal, lacking a distinct personality. A supporting content network is what brings your brand to life. It is your opportunity to tell compelling stories, to share strong opinions, and to connect with your audience on a more emotional level. This is a critical part of building a strong, memorable, and defensible brand that can stand out in a crowded market.

This type of content is also essential for staying relevant and timely in a fast-moving world. Your pillar content is designed to be timeless, but the conversations in your industry are not. Your supporting content network is where you can react to market changes, share your take on the latest news and trends, and demonstrate that you have your finger on the pulse of your industry. This is a key part of being seen as a dynamic leader, not just a static encyclopedia.

Furthermore, a supporting content network is a powerful way to build social proof and to accelerate the buying decision. Case studies provide concrete proof that your product or service delivers real-world results. Expert interviews show that you are a respected and connected player in your industry. This type of content can be incredibly persuasive, helping to build the trust and confidence that is essential for converting readers into loyal customers.

### Key Questions to Answer
- Do we have a good mix of supporting content that builds our brand's personality and provides social proof?
- Are we consistently telling the stories of our customers' success?
- Are we actively participating in the current conversations happening in our industry?

### Common Oversights
- **Only creating evergreen content.** While evergreen content is the foundation of your authority, you also need timely and topical content to stay relevant.
- **Making it all about you.** Your supporting content should not be a series of press releases. It should be a way to provide value and to tell compelling stories.
- **Forgetting to get permission.** Always get written permission from your customers and your partners before you feature them in your content.

### Your Action Steps
Brainstorm three ideas for supporting content that you could create in the next month. One idea should be a customer story or case study. One idea should be an interview with someone in your industry (it could even be a knowledgeable member of your own team). And one idea should be a short post sharing your company's perspective on a recent trend or news event. This simple exercise will help you to start thinking beyond purely educational content.

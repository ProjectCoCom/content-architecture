# Supporting Content Network

### What This Is
A supporting content network is the collection of all your other content assets that don't fit neatly into the pillar-and-cluster model but still play a crucial role in your overall content strategy. This includes assets like case studies, expert interviews, news-related content, company announcements, and cultural content. These pieces of content help to add depth, personality, and timeliness to your brand's voice.

This is the content that makes your brand human. While your pillar and cluster content is focused on building educational authority, your supporting content network is focused on building relationship and relevance. It's where you can share your company's unique perspective, celebrate your customers' successes, and engage with the current conversations in your industry.

By intentionally cultivating this network of supporting content, you create a more well-rounded and engaging content experience. You show your audience that you are not just a machine for producing educational content, but a vibrant and active participant in your industry. This is a key part of building a brand that people not only trust, but also like and want to connect with.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy that consists only of pillar and cluster content can feel a bit sterile and impersonal. A supporting content network is what brings your brand to life. It's your opportunity to tell stories, to share opinions, and to connect with your audience on a more emotional level. This is a critical part of building a strong and memorable brand.

This type of content is also essential for staying relevant and timely. The worlds of marketing and business are constantly changing. Your supporting content network is where you can react to these changes, share your take on the latest news and trends, and show your audience that you have your finger on the pulse of your industry. This is a key part of being seen as a leader, not just an educator.

Furthermore, a supporting content network can be a powerful way to build social proof and credibility. Case studies show that your product or service gets real-world results. Expert interviews show that you are connected to the key players in your industry. This type of content can be incredibly persuasive and can help to build the trust that is essential for converting readers into customers.



### Your Action Steps
Brainstorm three ideas for supporting content that you could create in the next month. One idea should be a customer story or case study. One idea should be an interview with someone in your industry (it could even be a knowledgeable member of your own team). And one idea should be a short post sharing your company's perspective on a recent trend or news event. This simple exercise will help you to start thinking beyond purely educational content.

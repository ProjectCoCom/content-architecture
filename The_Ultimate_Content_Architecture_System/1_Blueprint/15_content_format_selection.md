# Content Format Selection

### What This Is
Content format selection is the process of choosing the best format or medium for each piece of content you create. It's about recognizing that the way you present your information can be just as important as the information itself. This involves moving beyond a "blog-post-first" mentality and considering a wide range of formats, such as video, audio, infographics, interactive tools, and more.

The goal is to choose the format that is best suited to the topic, the target audience, and the desired outcome of the content. A complex, step-by-step process might be best explained in a video tutorial. A data-heavy report might be best presented as an interactive infographic. A nuanced, thought-provoking argument might be best explored in a long-form article or a podcast.

By being intentional about your content format selection, you can create a more engaging and effective content experience for your audience. You can make your content more memorable, more shareable, and more likely to achieve its intended goal.

### Why This Matters
People learn in different ways. Some people are visual learners, some are auditory learners, and some learn best by reading. By offering your content in a variety of formats, you can make it more accessible and more appealing to a wider range of people. This can help you to expand your reach and to build a more diverse and engaged audience.

The format of your content can also have a big impact on its performance. For example, video content is often more engaging and more shareable on social media than text-based content. Interactive tools can be a great way to generate leads and to capture valuable data. By choosing the right format for your content, you can significantly improve its chances of success.

Furthermore, a diverse portfolio of content formats can help you to build a stronger and more memorable brand. It shows that you are a creative and innovative company that is willing to invest in creating a high-quality content experience for your audience. It can also help you to stand out in a crowded market where many of your competitors are only creating one type of content.



### Your Action Steps
Take one of your most popular blog posts. Brainstorm three different ways that you could repurpose that content into a new format. For example, could you turn the key takeaways into an infographic? Could you record a short video of yourself explaining the main points? Could you create a simple slide deck that you could share on LinkedIn? This exercise will help you to start thinking beyond the blog post.

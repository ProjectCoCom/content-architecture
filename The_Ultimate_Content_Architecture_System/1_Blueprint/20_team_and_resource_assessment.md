# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic and honest evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, distribute, and measure the performance of your content. It is the process of taking a clear-eyed, realistic look at all of the resources you have at your disposal, including the skills and the available time of your people, the size and the allocation of your budget, and the capabilities of your technology stack. This is the critical reality check that ensures your content strategy is not just an ambitious and inspiring vision, but also a practical and achievable plan of action.

This is a holistic audit that should go far beyond a simple headcount of your marketing team. A comprehensive assessment should cover all of your potential content-related resources, including your internal team members and their specific skills, any external resources you may be using (such as freelance writers, designers, or agencies), and, just as importantly, your "hidden" or intangible content assets. These can include your library of existing content, the deep subject matter expertise of your in-house experts, your company's proprietary data and research, and your relationships with your customers and your industry partners.

By conducting this thorough and honest assessment, you can create a complete and multi-dimensional picture of your content program's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It is the foundational diagnostic process that allows you to identify any critical gaps in your team's skills, any significant bottlenecks in your production workflows, and any strategic areas where you may need to make a compelling business case for additional investment. It is the essential first step in building a truly sustainable, scalable, and successful content marketing program that is built on a solid foundation of reality.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy without a realistic and corresponding resource plan is nothing more than a well-intentioned wish list. It is easy to dream up a grand and ambitious content architecture, but if you do not have the people, the budget, and the tools to actually build and to maintain that architecture, your strategy is almost certainly doomed to fail. A rigorous and honest team and resource assessment is the essential and non-negotiable bridge that connects the grand vision of your strategy to the day-to-day reality of its execution. It is what makes your strategic goals achievable.

This systematic process is also your most powerful tool for making a clear, credible, and data-driven business case for the resources you need to be successful. It is not enough to simply ask for "more budget" or "another headcount." When you can walk into a leadership meeting with a detailed and objective assessment of your current capacity, a clear analysis of the specific gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, and a well-defined plan for how you will use any additional resources to drive a measurable business outcome, you are much more likely to get the investment and the support that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a comprehensive resource assessment can be a powerful catalyst for creativity and efficiency. By taking a complete inventory of all of your available assets, you will often discover "hidden" or underutilized resources that can be deployed to great effect. You might realize that your sales engineering team has a wealth of untapped subject matter expertise, that your product team is sitting on a goldmine of proprietary data that could be turned into a groundbreaking industry report, or that your customer success team has a direct line to a dozen happy customers who would be perfect for a case study. This process can help you to get significantly more done with the resources you already have and to maximize the return on investment of your entire content marketing program.

### Key Questions to Answer
- Do we have a realistic understanding of our team's capacity to create, manage, and distribute content?
- Have we identified any critical skills gaps on our team that are preventing us from achieving our goals?
- Are we making the most of all of the resources that are available to us, including our budget, our tools, and our "hidden" content assets?

### Common Oversights
- **Being overly ambitious.** Your content strategy needs to be aligned with your available resources. It's better to do a great job with a small amount of content than a mediocre job with a large amount of content.
- **Not investing in your team.** Your team is your most valuable resource. Make sure you are investing in their professional development and giving them the tools and the support they need to be successful.
- **Forgetting about your "hidden" resources.** Your subject matter experts, your proprietary data, and your customer stories are all valuable content assets. Make sure you are using them.

### Your Action Steps
Open the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1). In the "Team" section, list all of the people in your company who are involved in content creation, even if it's just a small part of their job. For each person, write down their primary content-related skill. In the "Tools" section, list all of the software and tools you are currently using for your content marketing. This simple inventory is a great first step in understanding your current content capacity.

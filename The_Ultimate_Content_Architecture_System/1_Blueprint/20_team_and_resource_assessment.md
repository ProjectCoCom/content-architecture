# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, and distribute content. It's about taking a realistic look at the people, the budget, the tools, and the time that you have available for your content marketing program. This is a critical reality check that will help you to create a content strategy that is not just ambitious, but also achievable.

This assessment should cover both your internal team and any external resources you may be using, such as freelancers, agencies, or consultants. It should also include an inventory of your "content assets," such as your existing content library, your subject matter experts, and your proprietary data.

By conducting this assessment, you can get a clear and honest picture of your strengths and weaknesses. You can identify any gaps in your team's skills, any bottlenecks in your workflow, and any areas where you may need to invest in additional resources. It's a foundational step for building a sustainable and scalable content marketing program.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy without a realistic resource plan is just a wish list. It's easy to come up with a lot of great content ideas, but if you don't have the resources to execute on those ideas, your strategy is doomed to fail. A team and resource assessment is essential for bridging the gap between your ambitions and your reality.

This process is also crucial for making a business case for the resources you need. When you can show your leadership team a clear and data-driven assessment of your current capacity and the gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, you are much more likely to get the budget and the headcount that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a resource assessment can help you to be more creative and efficient with the resources you already have. By identifying all of your available assets, you may discover "hidden" resources that you were not fully utilizing, such as the expertise of your sales team or the data from your product team. This can help you to get more done with less and to maximize the ROI of your content marketing program.



### Your Action Steps
Open the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1). In the "Team" section, list all of the people in your company who are involved in content creation, even if it's just a small part of their job. For each person, write down their primary content-related skill. In the "Tools" section, list all of the software and tools you are currently using for your content marketing. This simple inventory is a great first step in understanding your current content capacity.

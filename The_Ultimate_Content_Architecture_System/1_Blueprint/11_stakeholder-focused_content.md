# Stakeholder-Focused Content

### What This Is
Stakeholder-focused content is a strategy of creating specific content assets that are tailored to the unique needs, goals, and pain points of the different decision-makers and influencers involved in a purchase decision. In most B2B buying processes, there is not just one buyer, but a "buying committee" made up of multiple stakeholders, each with their own perspective and priorities. This strategy is about creating content that speaks directly to each of them.

This is a level of audience segmentation that goes beyond simple personas. It's about understanding the complex dynamics of the B2B buying process and creating content that can equip your internal champion to effectively sell your solution to their colleagues. This could mean creating a technical white paper for the IT director, a financial ROI calculator for the CFO, and a high-level strategic overview for the CEO.

By creating this stakeholder-focused content, you are not just marketing to a company; you are marketing to the individuals within that company. You are providing them with the specific information they need to do their job and to make a confident purchase decision. This is a sophisticated and highly effective way to navigate the complexities of the B2B sales process.

### Why This Matters
If you only create content for the end-user of your product, you are ignoring all of the other people who have a say in the purchase decision. The economic buyer, the technical buyer, the project manager—they all have different questions and concerns. If you fail to address their specific needs, your deal can easily get stalled or blocked. Stakeholder-focused content is essential for ensuring a smooth and successful buying process.

This approach is also a powerful way to build consensus and to create alignment within your target account. By providing content that speaks to the needs of each stakeholder, you are helping them to all get on the same page and to see the value of your solution from their own perspective. This can be a huge advantage, especially in a complex sale with a large buying committee.

Furthermore, stakeholder-focused content can be a powerful tool for your sales team. It equips them with the resources they need to have more relevant and persuasive conversations with each member of the buying committee. It can also help to shorten the sales cycle by proactively addressing the questions and objections of each stakeholder.



### Your Action Steps
Think about the last time you sold your product or service to a new customer. Who were the three main people involved in the decision? For each of those three stakeholders, open the "Stakeholder Content Mapping Worksheet" (Template 11.1) and write down their job title, their primary objective, and their biggest question or concern. This simple exercise will help you to start thinking about your content from the perspective of the entire buying committee.

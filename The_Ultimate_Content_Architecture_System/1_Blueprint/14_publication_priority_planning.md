# Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish next, based on a clear and consistent evaluation framework. It is the critical function that transforms a chaotic backlog of good ideas into a deliberate, high-impact content roadmap. This process moves a content team from a reactive state of simply grabbing the next task to a proactive one, where every decision is a calculated investment of limited resources designed to achieve a specific business outcome.

Think of yourself as a portfolio manager for your content. You have a finite amount of capital (time, budget, and team energy), and an almost infinite number of potential investments (content ideas). A priority plan is your investment thesis. It is the data-driven system you use to evaluate each potential investment against a set of criteria—such as audience demand, business value, and strategic fit—to determine which assets are most likely to yield the highest return. It is the crucial strategic layer that sits between your backlog of ideas and your content calendar.

Ultimately, this is about making conscious, strategic trade-offs. By developing a clear system for prioritizing your content, you create a powerful decision-making engine that ensures you are always working on the most valuable and impactful projects. It is the difference between being a "content factory" that measures success by volume and being a strategic content program that measures success by impact. It is the operational core of a truly professional and results-driven content function.

### Why This Matters
Without a clear system for prioritization, your content strategy will be dictated by the "loudest voice in the room," the latest fleeting trend, or the random idea that pops into your head in the shower. This leads to a scattered and ineffective content library that fails to build momentum or to drive meaningful business results. A publication priority plan is your primary defense against this chaos. It provides a rational, objective framework for making decisions, which is essential for ensuring that your most valuable and strategic content gets created in a timely manner.

This strategic approach is also crucial for protecting your team from burnout and for maintaining alignment with the broader business. A content team without a clear prioritization framework is constantly vulnerable to "drive-by" requests and shifting priorities, which can be demoralizing and incredibly inefficient. A transparent and agreed-upon system allows you to confidently say "no" to low-impact ideas and to clearly justify why you are focusing on certain topics over others. This builds trust with your stakeholders and ensures that your content strategy is always supporting the most important business objectives.

Furthermore, a data-driven prioritization process is your most powerful tool for making a compelling business case for your content program. When you can walk into a budget meeting and show that your decisions are based on a rigorous analysis of factors like search volume, conversion potential, and sales team needs, you can more easily justify your resource requests. It transforms the conversation from "we need more money to create more content" to "we need more money to capture these specific, high-value opportunities that we have identified and prioritized."

### Key Questions to Answer
- Do we have a clear and objective system for deciding what content to create next?
- Are we consistently focusing our limited resources on the content that will have the biggest impact on our business?
- Do we have a process for saying "no" to good ideas that are not as good as our top priorities?

### Common Oversights
- **Letting the "loudest voice in the room" dictate your priorities.** A good prioritization system is a defense against random, "drive-by" content requests.
- **Only focusing on SEO metrics.** While search volume is important, it's not the only thing that matters. Make sure you are also considering things like sales enablement value and brand building potential.
- **Not having a backlog of ideas.** A good prioritization system starts with a good backlog of ideas. Make sure you have a system for capturing all of your team's great ideas.

### Your Action Steps
Create a simple list of ten of your current content ideas. For each idea, give it a score from 1 to 5 on two criteria: "Audience Value" (how helpful would this be for our audience?) and "Business Value" (how much would this help us to achieve our business goals?). Add the two scores together to get a total score for each idea. This simple exercise will give you a rough but useful prioritization of your content backlog.

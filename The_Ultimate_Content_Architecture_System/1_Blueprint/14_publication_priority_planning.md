# Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish next. It's about moving from a reactive, "whatever comes to mind" approach to a deliberate and data-driven system for managing your content pipeline. This involves weighing a variety of factors, such as audience demand, business value, and strategic fit, to determine which content ideas will have the greatest impact.

This is not just about creating a content calendar. A content calendar tells you when you are going to publish something. A publication priority plan tells you why you are publishing it. It's the strategic layer that sits on top of your calendar, ensuring that your content creation efforts are always aligned with your most important goals.

By developing a clear and consistent system for prioritizing your content, you can ensure that you are always working on the most valuable and impactful content. It allows you to be more strategic with your limited resources and to build a content library that is not just large, but also highly effective.

### Why This Matters
You will always have more content ideas than you have the time and resources to create. Without a clear system for prioritization, you risk spending your time on low-impact content while high-impact opportunities are languishing in your backlog. A publication priority plan is essential for making sure that your most valuable content gets created and published in a timely manner.

This strategic approach is also crucial for maintaining alignment between your content team and the broader business. By having a clear and transparent system for prioritizing content, you can ensure that everyone understands why you are working on certain things and not on others. This can help to reduce friction and to ensure that your content strategy is always supporting the most important business objectives.

Furthermore, a data-driven prioritization process can help you to make a stronger business case for your content marketing efforts. When you can show that you are making deliberate choices based on factors like search volume, conversion potential, and sales enablement value, you can more easily justify your budget and your team's resources.



### Your Action Steps
Create a simple list of ten of your current content ideas. For each idea, give it a score from 1 to 5 on two criteria: "Audience Value" (how helpful would this be for our audience?) and "Business Value" (how much would this help us to achieve our business goals?). Add the two scores together to get a total score for each idea. This simple exercise will give you a rough but useful prioritization of your content backlog.

# Longtail Content Strategy

### What This Is
A longtail content strategy is an approach that focuses on creating a large volume of content that targets highly specific, low-volume keywords, known as "longtail keywords." These are often longer and more detailed search queries that reveal a user's specific intent. For example, instead of targeting the broad keyword "project management," a longtail strategy would target a keyword like "how to use a Gantt chart for a software development project."

This is a strategy of depth and specificity. It's about creating content that provides a precise and comprehensive answer to a very particular question. While each individual piece of longtail content may not attract a huge amount of traffic, the cumulative effect of hundreds or even thousands of these pieces can be a significant and sustainable source of highly qualified organic traffic.

By systematically targeting these longtail keywords, you are building a vast library of content that addresses the specific needs of your audience at every stage of their journey. You are not just creating content for the most popular topics; you are creating content for all the topics. This is how you build a truly comprehensive and authoritative content library.

### Why This Matters
The way people search is changing. They are using longer, more conversational queries, and they expect to find content that provides a direct and specific answer to their questions. A longtail content strategy is the most effective way to meet this changing user behavior. By creating content that is laser-focused on a specific user intent, you are providing a better and more satisfying search experience.

This approach is also a powerful way to compete in a crowded market. The broad, "head" keywords are often dominated by large, established brands with huge marketing budgets. A longtail strategy allows you to avoid this direct competition and to carve out your own niche by focusing on the less competitive, but often more valuable, longtail keywords.

Furthermore, the traffic that you attract from longtail keywords is often much more qualified than the traffic from broad keywords. A person who is searching for "best project management software for a small marketing team" is much further along in their buying journey than someone who is just searching for "project management." By creating content that targets these specific queries, you are attracting an audience that is closer to making a purchase decision.



### Your Action Steps
Open a keyword research tool or simply use the Google search bar. Type in one of your core topics and look at the "autocomplete" suggestions. Then, look at the "People Also Ask" and "Related Searches" sections of the search results. From these sources, create a list of ten longtail keywords that are relevant to your business. For each keyword, write a one-sentence summary of what a piece of content on that topic would cover.

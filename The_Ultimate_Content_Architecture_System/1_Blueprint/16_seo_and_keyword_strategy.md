# SEO & Keyword Strategy

### What This Is
An SEO and keyword strategy is the process of identifying the specific search terms that your target audience is using and creating content that is optimized to rank for those terms. It's about understanding the language of your audience and using that knowledge to create content that is discoverable, relevant, and valuable.

This is more than just picking a few keywords and stuffing them into your content. A modern SEO strategy is about understanding the user's intent behind the keyword and creating a piece of content that is the best possible answer to their question. It's about building topical authority, creating a great user experience, and earning the trust of both your audience and the search engines.

By developing a strategic approach to SEO and keywords, you can ensure that your content is getting in front of the right people at the right time. You can attract a steady stream of highly qualified organic traffic to your website and build a sustainable and profitable content marketing program.

### Why This Matters
Organic search is one of the most valuable and sustainable sources of traffic for most businesses. Unlike paid advertising, where you have to pay for every click, organic search traffic is "free" once you have made the initial investment in creating the content. A strong SEO and keyword strategy is the key to unlocking this valuable source of traffic.

This is also a powerful way to understand your audience on a deeper level. By analyzing the keywords that your audience is using, you can get valuable insights into their needs, their pain points, and their goals. This can help you to create more relevant and effective content, and it can also inform your product development and your overall business strategy.

Furthermore, a good SEO strategy can be a powerful competitive advantage. By ranking for your most important keywords, you can capture a significant amount of market share and can make it more difficult for your competitors to get in front of your target audience. It's a way to build a defensible "moat" around your business.



### Your Action Steps
Choose one of your existing blog posts. Open a free keyword research tool (or just use Google) and find one relevant keyword that the post could be optimized for. Then, go back to your post and make sure that keyword is in the title, in at least one of the headers, and in the first paragraph of the article. This simple on-page optimization exercise is a great first step in making your content more discoverable.

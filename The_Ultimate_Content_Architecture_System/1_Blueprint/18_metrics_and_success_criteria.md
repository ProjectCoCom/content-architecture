# Metrics & Success Criteria

### What This Is
Metrics and success criteria are the specific, measurable indicators that you use to track the performance of your content and to determine whether you are achieving your goals. It's about moving from a vague sense of "doing content marketing" to a data-driven understanding of what is working, what is not, and why.

This is more than just looking at your pageviews. A good measurement framework will include a variety of metrics that are tied to your specific business objectives. This could include metrics related to traffic, engagement, lead generation, and revenue. The goal is to create a holistic picture of your content's performance and to use that data to make smarter decisions.

By establishing clear metrics and success criteria, you can create a culture of accountability and continuous improvement within your content team. You can move beyond subjective opinions and gut feelings, and you can have a more objective and productive conversation about what it takes to be successful.

### Why This Matters
If you are not measuring the performance of your content, you are flying blind. You have no way of knowing whether your efforts are paying off, whether you are on the right track, or whether you need to make a course correction. Clear metrics and success criteria are essential for navigating the complexities of content marketing and for ensuring that you are on a path to success.

This data-driven approach is also crucial for making a business case for your content marketing program. When you can show your leadership team a clear and compelling story of how your content is driving traffic, generating leads, and contributing to revenue, you are much more likely to get the budget and the resources you need to be successful.

Furthermore, a good measurement framework is a powerful tool for learning and improvement. By analyzing your content performance data, you can get valuable insights into what is resonating with your audience, what is not, and where you should be focusing your efforts. This can help you to get better and better over time and to build a truly world-class content marketing program.



### Your Action Steps
Open your web analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics). Identify three of your most important content marketing metrics. For each metric, write down the current number and set a realistic goal for where you would like it to be in three months. For example, "Metric: Organic Traffic. Current: 1,000 visitors/month. Goal: 1,500 visitors/month." This simple exercise will help you to start thinking about your content in terms of specific, measurable goals.

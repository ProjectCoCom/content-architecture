# Stakeholder-Focused Content

### What This Is
Stakeholder-focused content is a strategy of creating specific content assets that are tailored to the unique needs, goals, and pain points of the different decision-makers and influencers involved in a purchase decision. In most B2B buying processes, there is not just one buyer, but a "buying committee" made up of multiple stakeholders, each with their own perspective and priorities. This strategy is about creating content that speaks directly to each of them.

This is a level of audience segmentation that goes beyond simple personas. It's about understanding the complex dynamics of the B2B buying process and creating content that can equip your internal champion to effectively sell your solution to their colleagues. This could mean creating a technical white paper for the IT director, a financial ROI calculator for the CFO, and a high-level strategic overview for the CEO.

By creating this stakeholder-focused content, you are not just marketing to a company; you are marketing to the individuals within that company. You are providing them with the specific information they need to do their job and to make a confident purchase decision. This is a sophisticated and highly effective way to navigate the complexities of the B2B sales process.

### Why This Matters
If you only create content for the end-user of your product, you are ignoring all of the other people who have a say in the purchase decision. The economic buyer, the technical buyer, the project manager—they all have different questions and concerns. If you fail to address their specific needs, your deal can easily get stalled or blocked. Stakeholder-focused content is essential for ensuring a smooth and successful buying process.

This approach is also a powerful way to build consensus and to create alignment within your target account. By providing content that speaks to the needs of each stakeholder, you are helping them to all get on the same page and to see the value of your solution from their own perspective. This can be a huge advantage, especially in a complex sale with a large buying committee.

Furthermore, stakeholder-focused content can be a powerful tool for your sales team. It equips them with the resources they need to have more relevant and persuasive conversations with each member of the buying committee. It can also help to shorten the sales cycle by proactively addressing the questions and objections of each stakeholder.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a stakeholder-focused content strategy involves a deep understanding of your target buying committee and a systematic process for creating tailored content.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this approach, the first step is to identify the three most common stakeholders involved in a typical purchase decision for your product. For each stakeholder, create a simple profile that outlines their role, their primary goal, and their biggest concern. Then, take one of your existing content pieces and create a "stakeholder-specific" version for each of your three profiles.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should have a detailed map of your entire buying committee, including five to seven key stakeholders. For each stakeholder, you should have a deep understanding of their "jobs to be done" and the specific questions they ask at each stage of the buying process. You should be creating a variety of content formats for each stakeholder, including articles, videos, and downloadable guides.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced stakeholder-focused content strategy, you should be creating personalized content journeys for each key stakeholder. This could involve using marketing automation to deliver a sequence of tailored content based on a person's role and behavior. You should also be creating "internal selling" tools for your champions, such as slide decks and email templates that they can use to persuade their colleagues.

### What You'll Need
To create stakeholder-focused content, you will need to have deep conversations with your sales team and with your customers to understand the dynamics of the buying committee. You will also need to create detailed "stakeholder personas" that go beyond simple demographics and focus on the specific goals, challenges, and questions of each role. Finally, you will need a content team that is skilled at creating a variety of content formats, from technical white papers to financial ROI calculators.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when your sales team starts to report that they are having more successful conversations with a wider range of stakeholders within their target accounts. You should also see an increase in the number of stakeholders from a single account who are engaging with your content. This is a sign that your content is being shared internally and that you are successfully reaching the entire buying committee. Another key metric is the deal velocity. You should see a decrease in the amount of time it takes to close a deal, as your content is helping to proactively address the questions and concerns of each stakeholder.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Map Your Buying Committee (1-3 hours)**
Work with your sales team to create a detailed map of the typical buying committee for your product. Identify the four to six most common stakeholders. For each stakeholder, use the "Stakeholder Content Mapping Worksheet" (Template 11.1) to document their role, their goals, their pain points, and the key questions they ask during the buying process.

> **Strategic Insight:** Don't just focus on the "what" of each stakeholder's role. Try to understand the "why." What are they trying to achieve in their career? What are they afraid of? The more you can understand their personal motivations, the more resonant your content will be.

**2. Audit Your Existing Content for Stakeholder Fit (1-2 hours)**
Take your list of stakeholders and review your existing content library. Is your content library heavily skewed towards one type of stakeholder (e.g., the end-user)? Are there any stakeholders for whom you have no content at all? This audit will help you to identify the biggest gaps in your stakeholder content strategy.

**3. Create a Stakeholder-Specific Content Plan (1-2 hours)**
Based on your audit, create a plan for creating new content that is tailored to your underserved stakeholders. For each stakeholder, brainstorm two to three content ideas that would directly address their specific questions and concerns. Prioritize these ideas based on their potential impact on your sales process.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Basing Your Stakeholder Profiles on Assumptions:** The only way to truly understand your buying committee is to talk to them. Don't rely on internal assumptions. Get on the phone with your customers and ask them about their buying process.
> - **Creating Content in a Silo:** Your stakeholder-focused content will only be effective if your sales team knows it exists and knows how to use it. Involve them in the creation process and create a plan for sales enablement.
> - **Forgetting About Your Champion:** One of the most important stakeholders is your internal champion. Make sure you are creating content that is designed to help them to sell your solution to their colleagues.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Creating stakeholder content that is just a slightly different version of the same thing.** Each piece of stakeholder content should have a unique angle and should provide unique value for that specific role. Don't just change the title and call it a day.
- **Not having a clear distribution plan for your stakeholder content.** How are you going to get your content in front of the right stakeholders? You will need to use a variety of channels, including targeted advertising, sales outreach, and account-based marketing (ABM) campaigns.
- **Forgetting to measure the impact of your stakeholder content.** You should be tracking how your stakeholder content is being used by your sales team and how it is impacting your key sales metrics, such as deal size, win rate, and sales cycle length.
- **Thinking of this as a one-time project.** The needs and concerns of your stakeholders will evolve over time. You should be regularly reviewing and updating your stakeholder personas and your content to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.

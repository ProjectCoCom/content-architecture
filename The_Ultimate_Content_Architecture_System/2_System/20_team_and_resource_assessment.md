# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic and honest evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, distribute, and measure the performance of your content. It is the process of taking a clear-eyed, realistic look at all of the resources you have at your disposal, including the skills and the available time of your people, the size and the allocation of your budget, and the capabilities of your technology stack. This is the critical reality check that ensures your content strategy is not just an ambitious and inspiring vision, but also a practical and achievable plan of action.

This is a holistic audit that should go far beyond a simple headcount of your marketing team. A comprehensive assessment should cover all of your potential content-related resources, including your internal team members and their specific skills, any external resources you may be using (such as freelance writers, designers, or agencies), and, just as importantly, your "hidden" or intangible content assets. These can include your library of existing content, the deep subject matter expertise of your in-house experts, your company's proprietary data and research, and your relationships with your customers and your industry partners.

By conducting this thorough and honest assessment, you can create a complete and multi-dimensional picture of your content program's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It is the foundational diagnostic process that allows you to identify any critical gaps in your team's skills, any significant bottlenecks in your production workflows, and any strategic areas where you may need to make a compelling business case for additional investment. It is the essential first step in building a truly sustainable, scalable, and successful content marketing program that is built on a solid foundation of reality.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy without a realistic and corresponding resource plan is nothing more than a well-intentioned wish list. It is easy to dream up a grand and ambitious content architecture, but if you do not have the people, the budget, and the tools to actually build and to maintain that architecture, your strategy is almost certainly doomed to fail. A rigorous and honest team and resource assessment is the essential and non-negotiable bridge that connects the grand vision of your strategy to the day-to-day reality of its execution. It is what makes your strategic goals achievable.

This systematic process is also your most powerful tool for making a clear, credible, and data-driven business case for the resources you need to be successful. It is not enough to simply ask for "more budget" or "another headcount." When you can walk into a leadership meeting with a detailed and objective assessment of your current capacity, a clear analysis of the specific gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, and a well-defined plan for how you will use any additional resources to drive a measurable business outcome, you are much more likely to get the investment and the support that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a comprehensive resource assessment can be a powerful catalyst for creativity and efficiency. By taking a complete inventory of all of your available assets, you will often discover "hidden" or underutilized resources that can be deployed to great effect. You might realize that your sales engineering team has a wealth of untapped subject matter expertise, that your product team is sitting on a goldmine of proprietary data that could be turned into a groundbreaking industry report, or that your customer success team has a direct line to a dozen happy customers who would be perfect for a case study. This process can help you to get significantly more done with the resources you already have and to maximize the return on investment of your entire content marketing program.

### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a team and resource assessment involves a systematic process of auditing your resources, identifying your gaps, and creating a plan to address them.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple inventory of your content marketing resources. This should include a list of all the people on your team who are involved in content, a rough estimate of the number of hours they are spending on content each week, and a list of the content marketing tools you are currently using.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, your assessment should be more comprehensive. You should be creating a "skills matrix" for your content team to identify their strengths and weaknesses. You should also be doing a more detailed budget analysis to understand your "cost per piece of content." At this stage, you should also be creating a plan for how you will fill any resource gaps, whether that's through hiring, training, or outsourcing.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content capacity model." This is a spreadsheet that can help you to predict how much content you can create in a given period of time based on your available resources. This will help you to create a more realistic and achievable content calendar. You should also be regularly re-evaluating your resource plan to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving content strategy.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Assessment:** A small startup has one full-time content marketer who is a great writer but has limited design and video skills.
- **Plan:**
    - The content marketer will focus on writing blog posts and white papers.
    - They will hire a freelance graphic designer to create infographics and social media visuals.
    - They will use a simple, template-based video creation tool to create short product tutorials.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Assessment:** A mid-sized company has a marketing team with a mix of skills, but they lack the deep clinical expertise to create truly authoritative content.
- **Plan:**
    - They will create a "subject matter expert (SME)" program to get regular contributions from their internal clinical specialists.
    - They will build relationships with a few key opinion leaders (KOLs) in their industry to co-author articles and webinars.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Assessment:** A large company has a big marketing budget but a slow and bureaucratic content creation process.
- **Plan:**
    - They will implement a new project management tool and a more agile content workflow to speed up their production process.
    - They will empower their brand managers to create more of their own content, rather than relying on a centralized content team.

### What You'll Need
To conduct a team and resource assessment, you will need to have honest conversations with your team members about their skills, their workload, and their career goals. You will also need to work with your finance department to get a clear picture of your content marketing budget. Finally, you will need a good understanding of your content strategy and your goals to be able to identify your resource gaps.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and documented "resource plan" that outlines your current resources, your future needs, and your plan for filling the gaps. Another key indicator is an improvement in your team's morale and productivity. When your team members feel that they have the right skills, the right tools, and the right amount of time to do their jobs, they are much more likely to be engaged and effective. You should also see an improvement in the quality and the consistency of your content output.
### The 'Why' Behind the 'How'
A content strategy without a realistic resource plan is just a wish list. A team and resource assessment is the essential and non-negotiable bridge that connects the grand vision of your strategy to the day-to-day reality of its execution. It's how you can create a content plan that is not just ambitious, but also achievable.

### Resource Spotlight
- **Tool:** "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1)
- **Further Reading:** "The E-Myth Revisited" by Michael E. Gerber. This book provides a powerful framework for thinking about how to build systems and to delegate work, which is a key part of scaling your content program.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Conduct a Content Team Skills Audit (1-2 hours)**
Using the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1), create a skills matrix for your content team. List all of the key skills you need for your content marketing program (e.g., writing, editing, design, video, SEO) and then rate each team member's proficiency in each of those skills. This will give you a clear picture of your team's strengths and weaknesses.

> **Strategic Insight:** A skills audit is not just about identifying your weaknesses; it's also about identifying your hidden strengths. You might discover that your social media manager is a talented amateur videographer, or that your product marketer is a great public speaker. These are valuable assets that you can be using in your content marketing program.

**2. Analyze Your Content Budget and Tools (1 hour)**
Do a detailed analysis of your content marketing budget. How much are you spending on people, on tools, and on freelancers? Are you getting a good return on your investment? You should also do an audit of your content marketing tools. Are you using all of the tools you are paying for? Are there any tools that you could be using more effectively?

**3. Create Your Resource Plan (1-2 hours)**
Based on your skills audit and your budget analysis, create a resource plan for the next 6-12 months. This plan should outline any new hires you need to make, any training you need to provide, and any new tools or freelancers you need to invest in. This plan will be your roadmap for building a more capable and effective content team.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Not Being Honest About Your Team's Weaknesses:** It can be uncomfortable to have an honest conversation about your team's skills gaps. But if you are not honest with yourself, you will never be able to improve.
> - **Only Thinking About Hiring:** Hiring is not the only way to fill a skills gap. You can also train your existing team members, hire freelancers, or build relationships with agencies.
> - **Not Getting Buy-In for Your Plan:** Your resource plan will likely require you to get budget and approval from your leadership team. Make sure you are making a strong business case for the resources you are asking for.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Assuming that you need a huge team to be successful.** Some of the most successful content marketing programs are run by very small teams. The key is to be strategic, to be efficient, and to focus on the things that will have the biggest impact.
- **Not investing in the professional development of your team.** The world of content marketing is constantly changing. You need to be investing in the training and the development of your team to ensure that they are always on the cutting edge.
- **Forgetting about your "soft" resources.** Your resources are not just your people and your budget. They are also your brand's reputation, your company's culture, and your relationships with your customers and your partners. Make sure you are leveraging all of these assets in your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for onboarding new team members or freelancers.** As you scale your content program, you will likely be bringing on new people. Make sure you have a clear and consistent process for onboarding them and for getting them up to speed on your strategy, your workflow, and your brand's voice.

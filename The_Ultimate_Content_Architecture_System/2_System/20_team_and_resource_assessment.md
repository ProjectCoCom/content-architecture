# Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
A team and resource assessment is a systematic evaluation of your current capacity to create, manage, and distribute content. It's about taking a realistic look at the people, the budget, the tools, and the time that you have available for your content marketing program. This is a critical reality check that will help you to create a content strategy that is not just ambitious, but also achievable.

This assessment should cover both your internal team and any external resources you may be using, such as freelancers, agencies, or consultants. It should also include an inventory of your "content assets," such as your existing content library, your subject matter experts, and your proprietary data.

By conducting this assessment, you can get a clear and honest picture of your strengths and weaknesses. You can identify any gaps in your team's skills, any bottlenecks in your workflow, and any areas where you may need to invest in additional resources. It's a foundational step for building a sustainable and scalable content marketing program.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy without a realistic resource plan is just a wish list. It's easy to come up with a lot of great content ideas, but if you don't have the resources to execute on those ideas, your strategy is doomed to fail. A team and resource assessment is essential for bridging the gap between your ambitions and your reality.

This process is also crucial for making a business case for the resources you need. When you can show your leadership team a clear and data-driven assessment of your current capacity and the gaps that are preventing you from achieving your goals, you are much more likely to get the budget and the headcount that you are asking for.

Furthermore, a resource assessment can help you to be more creative and efficient with the resources you already have. By identifying all of your available assets, you may discover "hidden" resources that you were not fully utilizing, such as the expertise of your sales team or the data from your product team. This can help you to get more done with less and to maximize the ROI of your content marketing program.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a team and resource assessment involves a systematic process of auditing your resources, identifying your gaps, and creating a plan to address them.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple inventory of your content marketing resources. This should include a list of all the people on your team who are involved in content, a rough estimate of the number of hours they are spending on content each week, and a list of the content marketing tools you are currently using.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, your assessment should be more comprehensive. You should be creating a "skills matrix" for your content team to identify their strengths and weaknesses. You should also be doing a more detailed budget analysis to understand your "cost per piece of content." At this stage, you should also be creating a plan for how you will fill any resource gaps, whether that's through hiring, training, or outsourcing.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content capacity model." This is a spreadsheet that can help you to predict how much content you can create in a given period of time based on your available resources. This will help you to create a more realistic and achievable content calendar. You should also be regularly re-evaluating your resource plan to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving content strategy.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Assessment:** A small startup has one full-time content marketer who is a great writer but has limited design and video skills.
- **Plan:**
    - The content marketer will focus on writing blog posts and white papers.
    - They will hire a freelance graphic designer to create infographics and social media visuals.
    - They will use a simple, template-based video creation tool to create short product tutorials.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Assessment:** A mid-sized company has a marketing team with a mix of skills, but they lack the deep clinical expertise to create truly authoritative content.
- **Plan:**
    - They will create a "subject matter expert (SME)" program to get regular contributions from their internal clinical specialists.
    - They will build relationships with a few key opinion leaders (KOLs) in their industry to co-author articles and webinars.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Assessment:** A large company has a big marketing budget but a slow and bureaucratic content creation process.
- **Plan:**
    - They will implement a new project management tool and a more agile content workflow to speed up their production process.
    - They will empower their brand managers to create more of their own content, rather than relying on a centralized content team.

### What You'll Need
To conduct a team and resource assessment, you will need to have honest conversations with your team members about their skills, their workload, and their career goals. You will also need to work with your finance department to get a clear picture of your content marketing budget. Finally, you will need a good understanding of your content strategy and your goals to be able to identify your resource gaps.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and documented "resource plan" that outlines your current resources, your future needs, and your plan for filling the gaps. Another key indicator is an improvement in your team's morale and productivity. When your team members feel that they have the right skills, the right tools, and the right amount of time to do their jobs, they are much more likely to be engaged and effective. You should also see an improvement in the quality and the consistency of your content output.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Conduct a Content Team Skills Audit (1-2 hours)**
Using the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1), create a skills matrix for your content team. List all of the key skills you need for your content marketing program (e.g., writing, editing, design, video, SEO) and then rate each team member's proficiency in each of those skills. This will give you a clear picture of your team's strengths and weaknesses.

> **Strategic Insight:** A skills audit is not just about identifying your weaknesses; it's also about identifying your hidden strengths. You might discover that your social media manager is a talented amateur videographer, or that your product marketer is a great public speaker. These are valuable assets that you can be using in your content marketing program.

**2. Analyze Your Content Budget and Tools (1 hour)**
Do a detailed analysis of your content marketing budget. How much are you spending on people, on tools, and on freelancers? Are you getting a good return on your investment? You should also do an audit of your content marketing tools. Are you using all of the tools you are paying for? Are there any tools that you could be using more effectively?

**3. Create Your Resource Plan (1-2 hours)**
Based on your skills audit and your budget analysis, create a resource plan for the next 6-12 months. This plan should outline any new hires you need to make, any training you need to provide, and any new tools or freelancers you need to invest in. This plan will be your roadmap for building a more capable and effective content team.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Not Being Honest About Your Team's Weaknesses:** It can be uncomfortable to have an honest conversation about your team's skills gaps. But if you are not honest with yourself, you will never be able to improve.
> - **Only Thinking About Hiring:** Hiring is not the only way to fill a skills gap. You can also train your existing team members, hire freelancers, or build relationships with agencies.
> - **Not Getting Buy-In for Your Plan:** Your resource plan will likely require you to get budget and approval from your leadership team. Make sure you are making a strong business case for the resources you are asking for.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Assuming that you need a huge team to be successful.** Some of the most successful content marketing programs are run by very small teams. The key is to be strategic, to be efficient, and to focus on the things that will have the biggest impact.
- **Not investing in the professional development of your team.** The world of content marketing is constantly changing. You need to be investing in the training and the development of your team to ensure that they are always on the cutting edge.
- **Forgetting about your "soft" resources.** Your resources are not just your people and your budget. They are also your brand's reputation, your company's culture, and your relationships with your customers and your partners. Make sure you are leveraging all of these assets in your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for onboarding new team members or freelancers.** As you scale your content program, you will likely be bringing on new people. Make sure you have a clear and consistent process for onboarding them and for getting them up to speed on your strategy, your workflow, and your brand's voice.

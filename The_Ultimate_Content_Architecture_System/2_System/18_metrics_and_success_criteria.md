# Metrics & Success Criteria

### What This Is
Metrics and success criteria are the specific, measurable indicators that you use to track the performance of your content and to determine whether you are achieving your goals. It's about moving from a vague sense of "doing content marketing" to a data-driven understanding of what is working, what is not, and why.

This is more than just looking at your pageviews. A good measurement framework will include a variety of metrics that are tied to your specific business objectives. This could include metrics related to traffic, engagement, lead generation, and revenue. The goal is to create a holistic picture of your content's performance and to use that data to make smarter decisions.

By establishing clear metrics and success criteria, you can create a culture of accountability and continuous improvement within your content team. You can move beyond subjective opinions and gut feelings, and you can have a more objective and productive conversation about what it takes to be successful.

### Why This Matters
If you are not measuring the performance of your content, you are flying blind. You have no way of knowing whether your efforts are paying off, whether you are on the right track, or whether you need to make a course correction. Clear metrics and success criteria are essential for navigating the complexities of content marketing and for ensuring that you are on a path to success.

This data-driven approach is also crucial for making a business case for your content marketing program. When you can show your leadership team a clear and compelling story of how your content is driving traffic, generating leads, and contributing to revenue, you are much more likely to get the budget and the resources you need to be successful.

Furthermore, a good measurement framework is a powerful tool for learning and improvement. By analyzing your content performance data, you can get valuable insights into what is resonating with your audience, what is not, and where you should be focusing your efforts. This can help you to get better and better over time and to build a truly world-class content marketing program.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a metrics and success criteria framework involves a systematic process of choosing your metrics, setting your goals, and building your reports.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to focus on a few key "vanity" and "engagement" metrics. This includes things like total pageviews, unique visitors, time on page, and bounce rate. You should be tracking these metrics on a monthly basis to get a basic sense of your content's performance.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be tracking a more sophisticated set of metrics that are tied to your business goals. This includes things like organic traffic growth, conversion rate, cost per lead, and the number of marketing qualified leads (MQLs) generated by your content. You should be using a tool like Google Analytics to create a customized "content marketing dashboard" to track these metrics.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be tracking metrics that are directly tied to revenue. This includes things like customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (LTV), and the ROI of your content marketing program. You should also be using multi-touch attribution to get a more accurate picture of how your different content assets are contributing to your revenue goals.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Goal:** Generate more free trial sign-ups.
- **Metrics:**
    - Number of free trial sign-ups from blog content.
    - Conversion rate of blog traffic to free trial.
    - Cost per trial from content marketing.
    - LTV of customers who came from content marketing.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Goal:** Generate more qualified leads for the sales team.
- **Metrics:**
    - Number of demo requests from content.
    - Number of MQLs generated by content.
    - "Content-influenced" sales pipeline.
    - Average deal size for content-sourced leads.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Goal:** Drive more online sales.
- **Metrics:**
    - Revenue from blog content.
    - Conversion rate of blog traffic to purchase.
    - Average order value (AOV) of content-driven customers.
    - Repeat purchase rate of content-driven customers.

### What You'll Need
To track your content marketing metrics, you will need a web analytics platform, such as Google Analytics. You will also need to have "goal tracking" and "event tracking" set up in your analytics platform to measure your conversions. Finally, you may need to use a more advanced marketing analytics tool or a business intelligence (BI) platform to connect your content performance data to your revenue data.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and concise "content marketing dashboard" that you are reviewing on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly). This dashboard should give you an at-a-glance view of your performance against your key metrics. You should also be able to tell a clear and compelling story about your content's performance to your stakeholders, using the data from your dashboard. When your content performance reviews move from a discussion of "what we did" to "what we learned and what we're going to do next," you'll know that your measurement framework is working.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Define Your Content Marketing KPIs (1-2 hours)**
Work with your stakeholders to define three to five key performance indicators (KPIs) for your content marketing program. These KPIs should be directly tied to your most important business objectives.

> **Strategic Insight:** A good way to choose your KPIs is to use the "SMART" framework. Your KPIs should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, a good KPI is "Increase the number of MQLs from our blog by 20% in the next quarter."

**2. Set Up Your Goal Tracking (1-3 hours)**
In your analytics platform, set up goal tracking for all of your key conversion actions. This could include things like newsletter sign-ups, ebook downloads, webinar registrations, and demo requests. This is a critical step for being able to measure the ROI of your content.

**3. Build Your Content Marketing Dashboard (1-2 hours)**
Create a customized dashboard in your analytics platform that shows all of your content marketing KPIs in one place. This will be your single source of truth for your content performance. Share this dashboard with your stakeholders to keep them informed of your progress.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Tracking Too Many Metrics:** It's better to have a few key metrics that you track consistently than a dozen metrics that you only look at once in a while.
> - **Only Tracking "Vanity" Metrics:** Pageviews and social likes can be nice to look at, but they don't tell you whether your content is actually driving business results. Focus on the metrics that matter.
> - **Not Having a Regular Reporting Cadence:** Your data is only useful if you are looking at it on a regular basis. Set aside some time each week or each month to review your dashboard and to analyze your performance.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Not having a clear baseline.** Before you can set goals, you need to know where you are starting from. Make sure you have a clear understanding of your current performance before you start setting targets for the future.
- **Setting unrealistic goals.** Your goals should be ambitious, but they should also be achievable. Setting goals that are impossible to reach can be demoralizing for your team.
- **Not having a clear plan for what you will do with the data.** Your data is only useful if you are using it to make decisions. For every metric you track, you should have a clear idea of what you will do if that metric goes up or down.
- **Forgetting about the qualitative feedback.** While data is important, it doesn't tell you the whole story. Make sure you are also collecting qualitative feedback from your audience, your sales team, and your other stakeholders to get a more complete picture of your performance.

# Supporting Content Network

### What This Is
A supporting content network is the collection of all your other content assets that don't fit neatly into the pillar-and-cluster model but still play a crucial role in your overall content strategy. This includes assets like case studies, expert interviews, news-related content, company announcements, and cultural content. These pieces of content help to add depth, personality, and timeliness to your brand's voice.

This is the content that makes your brand human. While your pillar and cluster content is focused on building educational authority, your supporting content network is focused on building relationship and relevance. It's where you can share your company's unique perspective, celebrate your customers' successes, and engage with the current conversations in your industry.

By intentionally cultivating this network of supporting content, you create a more well-rounded and engaging content experience. You show your audience that you are not just a machine for producing educational content, but a vibrant and active participant in your industry. This is a key part of building a brand that people not only trust, but also like and want to connect with.

### Why This Matters
A content strategy that consists only of pillar and cluster content can feel a bit sterile and impersonal. A supporting content network is what brings your brand to life. It's your opportunity to tell stories, to share opinions, and to connect with your audience on a more emotional level. This is a critical part of building a strong and memorable brand.

This type of content is also essential for staying relevant and timely. The worlds of marketing and business are constantly changing. Your supporting content network is where you can react to these changes, share your take on the latest news and trends, and show your audience that you have your finger on the pulse of your industry. This is a key part of being seen as a leader, not just an educator.

Furthermore, a supporting content network can be a powerful way to build social proof and credibility. Case studies show that your product or service gets real-world results. Expert interviews show that you are connected to the key players in your industry. This type of content can be incredibly persuasive and can help to build the trust that is essential for converting readers into customers.



### How This Works in Practice
Building a supporting content network is about diversifying your content portfolio and creating a regular cadence for different types of content.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those just starting out, the goal is to create at least one or two pieces of supporting content each month. This could be a simple case study, a short interview with a customer, or a blog post sharing your company's perspective on a recent industry event. The key is to start building the habit of creating content that is not strictly educational.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should have a more structured plan for your supporting content. This should include a regular cadence for different types of content, such as one case study per month, one expert interview per quarter, and a weekly "news roundup" post. You should also be actively looking for opportunities to insert this supporting content into your marketing and sales funnels.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced supporting content network, you should be thinking like a media company. This means having a diverse portfolio of content formats, including video, audio, and interactive content. You should also be building relationships with a wide range of industry experts and influencers who can contribute to your content. Finally, you should have a system for measuring the impact of your supporting content on your brand's reputation and your business's bottom line.

### What You'll Need
To build a supporting content network, you will need a content calendar that can accommodate a variety of content types. You will also need to build relationships with your customers, with industry experts, and with your own internal team members to get the stories and insights that will fuel this content. Finally, you will need a strong sense of your brand's voice and personality to ensure that this content is authentic and engaging.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you see an increase in the social engagement and shareability of your content. Your supporting content network is designed to be more personal and shareable than your educational content. When you see your audience sharing your content and talking about it on social media, it is a sign that you are creating a brand that people want to connect with. Another key indicator is an increase in your branded search traffic. As you build a stronger and more memorable brand, you should see more people searching for your company by name.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Identify Your Supporting Content Categories (30-60 minutes)**
Decide on three to five categories of supporting content that you will create on a regular basis. These categories should align with your brand's personality and your audience's interests. For each category, define its purpose and its target audience.

> **Strategic Insight:** A great way to choose your supporting content categories is to think about the different ways you want to build trust with your audience. Case studies build trust through results. Expert interviews build trust through association. Cultural content builds trust through transparency and authenticity.

**2. Create a Cadence for Your Supporting Content (15-30 minutes)**
In your content calendar, create a regular schedule for your supporting content. This could be as simple as "one case study on the first Monday of every month" or "a news roundup every Friday." A regular cadence will help you to be more consistent and will give your audience something to look forward to.

**3. Develop a Process for Sourcing Supporting Content (Ongoing)**
Your supporting content will require you to be more proactive in sourcing stories and insights. Create a simple process for identifying potential case study customers, for reaching out to industry experts, and for staying on top of the latest industry news. This will make it much easier to maintain your content cadence.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Making Your Supporting Content Too Salesy:** Your supporting content should be about building relationships, not about selling your product. Keep the focus on the story and the value for the reader.
> - **Not Getting Buy-In from Other Teams:** You will need the help of your sales team to find case study customers and your leadership team to get unique perspectives on industry news. Make sure they are on board with your plan.
> - **Being Inconsistent:** A supporting content network is most effective when it is nurtured over time. Try to be as consistent as possible with your publishing schedule.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Creating supporting content that is not aligned with your brand.** Your supporting content should be a reflection of your company's values and personality. If it feels generic or inauthentic, it will do more harm than good.
- **Not having a clear purpose for each piece of content.** While supporting content is not as directly tied to your sales funnel as your educational content, it should still have a clear strategic purpose. Whether it's to build social proof, to increase brand awareness, or to drive social engagement, make sure you know what you are trying to achieve.
- **Forgetting to promote your supporting content.** Your supporting content can be a great way to reach a new audience. Make sure you are sharing it on social media, in your email newsletter, and with any customers or experts who are featured in the content.
- **Not getting the proper permissions.** When you are creating case studies or featuring interviews with experts, it is crucial that you get their permission to use their name, their story, and their image. A simple release form can save you a lot of legal headaches down the road.

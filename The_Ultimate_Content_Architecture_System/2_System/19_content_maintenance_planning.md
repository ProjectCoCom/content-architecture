# Content Maintenance Planning

### What This Is
Content maintenance planning is the process of creating a system for regularly reviewing, updating, and refreshing your existing content to ensure that it remains accurate, relevant, and effective. It's about treating your content library as a living asset that requires ongoing care and attention, not just a "publish and forget" archive.

This involves a variety of tasks, such as updating outdated information, fixing broken links, improving on-page SEO, and "upcycling" old content into new formats. The goal is to extend the lifespan of your content and to ensure that you are getting the maximum possible value out of the investment you have already made.

By creating a content maintenance plan, you can protect your brand's reputation, improve your SEO performance, and create a better experience for your audience. It's a critical, but often overlooked, part of a sustainable and successful content strategy.

### Why This Matters
The world is constantly changing. The information that was accurate and relevant a year ago may be outdated and even harmful today. Outdated content can damage your brand's credibility and can lead to a poor user experience. A content maintenance plan is essential for ensuring that your content is always a trustworthy and reliable source of information.

This is also a huge opportunity for SEO. Search engines prefer fresh and up-to-date content. By regularly updating and improving your existing content, you can often get a significant boost in your search rankings with much less effort than it would take to create a new piece of content from scratch. This is one of the highest-ROI activities in content marketing.

Furthermore, a content maintenance plan can help you to be more efficient with your content creation resources. Instead of constantly having to create new content, you can get more value out of the content you already have. This can free up your team to focus on creating new, high-impact content and to experiment with new formats and channels.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a content maintenance plan involves a systematic process of auditing your content, identifying what needs to be updated, and creating a schedule for making those updates.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to do a simple "content decay" audit. Look at your analytics and identify your top 10 most popular articles from two years ago. Review each of those articles and make a note of any information that is now outdated. Create a simple plan to update those 10 articles over the next few months.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be doing a comprehensive content audit of your entire library on an annual basis. You should be categorizing your content into three buckets: "Keep," "Update," or "Delete." For the content that you decide to update, you should create a detailed plan for what needs to be changed and when.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be creating a "content maintenance score" for each piece of content on your site. This score could be based on a variety of factors, such as the age of the content, its traffic, its conversion rate, and its strategic importance. You can then use this score to prioritize your maintenance efforts and to ensure that you are always working on the most valuable content.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **Maintenance Task:** An old article on "The Best Project Management Tools of 2021" is still getting a lot of traffic, but the information is outdated.
- **Action:** Update the article with the latest information for 2024, including new tools, new features, and new pricing. Re-promote the updated article to your audience.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **Maintenance Task:** A clinical guide on your website refers to a medical study that has since been updated with new findings.
- **Action:** Update the guide with the new information and add a note to indicate when the content was last updated. This is crucial for maintaining credibility in a scientific field.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **Maintenance Task:** A popular blog post on "How to Care for Your Linen Clothing" has a broken link to a recommended laundry detergent.
- **Action:** Fix the broken link. While you're there, you could also add a short video tutorial to make the content even more helpful.

### What You'll Need
To create a content maintenance plan, you will need a content inventory spreadsheet that lists all of the content on your website. You will also need access to your web analytics to identify which content is still getting traffic and which is not. Finally, you will need a content calendar or a project management tool to schedule your content updates.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you can see a "resurgence" in the traffic and engagement of your updated content. When you update an old piece of content and you see its traffic, rankings, and conversion rate start to climb, it's a clear sign that your maintenance plan is working. You should also see a decrease in the number of "404 not found" errors in your Google Search Console report, which is a sign that you are doing a good job of fixing your broken links.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Conduct a Content Audit (2-4 hours)**
Create a spreadsheet of all of your blog posts. For each post, include the URL, the publication date, the organic traffic for the last year, and the number of conversions. This will be your master content inventory.

> **Strategic Insight:** A content audit can feel like a daunting task, but it's one of the most valuable exercises you can do. It will give you a brutally honest assessment of your content library and will help you to make much smarter decisions about where to focus your efforts.

**2. Categorize Your Content (1-2 hours)**
For each piece of content in your inventory, assign it to one of three categories: "Keep" (the content is still accurate and performing well), "Update" (the content is on a good topic but needs to be refreshed), or "Delete" (the content is outdated, irrelevant, and not worth saving).

**3. Create a Content Maintenance Plan (1 hour per quarter)**
For all of the content in your "Update" category, create a prioritized plan for how and when you will update it. You can use a scoring model similar to the one you used for your publication priority planning to help you to prioritize your maintenance efforts.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Being Afraid to Delete Content:** It can be hard to delete content that you have spent time and money creating. But sometimes, it's the best thing to do. Low-quality, irrelevant content can hurt your SEO and your brand.
> - **Not Redirecting Your Deleted Content:** If you do decide to delete a piece of content, make sure you 301 redirect the old URL to a new, relevant page. This will ensure that you don't lose any of the "link equity" that the old page had.
> - **Only Focusing on Your "Losers":** Content maintenance is not just about fixing your worst-performing content. It's also about making your best-performing content even better.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Thinking of content maintenance as a one-time project.** Content maintenance is an ongoing process that should be a regular part of your content marketing program.
- **Not having a clear process for making updates.** You should have a clear workflow for how you will identify, prioritize, and execute your content updates. This will help you to be more efficient and to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Forgetting to re-promote your updated content.** When you update an old piece of content, it's a great opportunity to re-promote it to your audience. You can share it on social media, send it out to your email list, and even run some paid ads to it.
- **Not tracking the results of your content maintenance efforts.** You should be tracking the performance of your updated content to see if your efforts are paying off. This will help you to learn what works and to get better over time.

# Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish next, based on a clear and consistent evaluation framework. It is the critical function that transforms a chaotic backlog of good ideas into a deliberate, high-impact content roadmap. This process moves a content team from a reactive state of simply grabbing the next task to a proactive one, where every decision is a calculated investment of limited resources designed to achieve a specific business outcome.

Think of yourself as a portfolio manager for your content. You have a finite amount of capital (time, budget, and team energy), and an almost infinite number of potential investments (content ideas). A priority plan is your investment thesis. It is the data-driven system you use to evaluate each potential investment against a set of criteria—such as audience demand, business value, and strategic fit—to determine which assets are most likely to yield the highest return. It is the crucial strategic layer that sits between your backlog of ideas and your content calendar.

Ultimately, this is about making conscious, strategic trade-offs. By developing a clear system for prioritizing your content, you create a powerful decision-making engine that ensures you are always working on the most valuable and impactful projects. It is the difference between being a "content factory" that measures success by volume and being a strategic content program that measures success by impact. It is the operational core of a truly professional and results-driven content function.

### Why This Matters
Without a clear system for prioritization, your content strategy will be dictated by the "loudest voice in the room," the latest fleeting trend, or the random idea that pops into your head in the shower. This leads to a scattered and ineffective content library that fails to build momentum or to drive meaningful business results. A publication priority plan is your primary defense against this chaos. It provides a rational, objective framework for making decisions, which is essential for ensuring that your most valuable and strategic content gets created in a timely manner.

This strategic approach is also crucial for protecting your team from burnout and for maintaining alignment with the broader business. A content team without a clear prioritization framework is constantly vulnerable to "drive-by" requests and shifting priorities, which can be demoralizing and incredibly inefficient. A transparent and agreed-upon system allows you to confidently say "no" to low-impact ideas and to clearly justify why you are focusing on certain topics over others. This builds trust with your stakeholders and ensures that your content strategy is always supporting the most important business objectives.

Furthermore, a data-driven prioritization process is your most powerful tool for making a compelling business case for your content program. When you can walk into a budget meeting and show that your decisions are based on a rigorous analysis of factors like search volume, conversion potential, and sales team needs, you can more easily justify your resource requests. It transforms the conversation from "we need more money to create more content" to "we need more money to capture these specific, high-value opportunities that we have identified and prioritized."

### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a publication priority plan involves creating a scoring system for your content ideas, using that system to rank your content backlog, and then having a regular process for reviewing and adjusting your priorities. The goal is to create a living, breathing system that adapts to your evolving business needs.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple prioritization matrix. This is a 2x2 grid that plots your content ideas based on their "Audience Impact" (how valuable is this to our audience?) on one axis and their "Business Impact" (how much will this help us achieve our goals?) on the other. Your goal is to focus almost exclusively on the content that falls into the "High Audience Impact / High Business Impact" quadrant. This simple exercise will force you to think strategically and to make your first set of conscious trade-offs.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be using a more sophisticated, multi-factor scoring model. This is typically a spreadsheet that assigns a numerical score to each content idea based on a variety of weighted criteria. Common criteria include "Search Volume Potential," "Keyword Difficulty," "Potential Business Value" (e.g., lead generation), and "Strategic Fit" with your core topics. By creating a "Total Priority Score" for each idea, you can generate a data-driven, rank-ordered list of your content backlog, which then informs your content calendar.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be using a weighted scoring model that is dynamically tied to your company's quarterly and annual objectives. For example, if the company's primary goal for the quarter is to acquire new enterprise customers, you might increase the weighting for criteria like "Sales Enablement Value" and "Targets a Key Account Persona." You should also be using a more formal prioritization framework like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) to create a more nuanced and objective evaluation. The output is a highly strategic and adaptable system that ensures your content plan is always perfectly aligned with the most important priorities of the business.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **High Priority:** A cluster article on "best project management software for marketing agencies." This is high priority because it targets a high-value customer segment, the keyword has strong buying intent, and the sales team has explicitly asked for it to help them in competitive deals.
- **Medium Priority:** A supporting content piece on "a day in the life of a remote product manager." This is medium priority because while it is great for brand building and attracting a relevant audience, its direct impact on lead generation is lower than the high-priority piece.
- **Low Priority:** A longtail article on a niche, power-user feature. This is low priority because the audience size is very small, and it is unlikely to attract new customers or to have a significant impact on the company's primary business goals.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **High Priority:** A stakeholder-focused ROI calculator for hospital administrators. This is high priority because it directly addresses a key pain point for the economic buyer and can significantly accelerate the sales cycle for high-value deals.
- **Medium Priority:** A comprehensive pillar page on a broad clinical topic. This is medium priority because while it is important for building long-term topical authority, it is a significant investment and its business impact is less direct and immediate.
- **Low Priority:** A company announcement about a minor industry award. This is low priority because the content has a very short shelf life, a limited audience, and minimal impact on lead generation or sales enablement.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **High Priority:** A comparative article on "the 10 best sustainable t-shirt brands on the market." This is high priority because it targets a high-volume, high-intent keyword, can attract a large new audience, and can drive direct sales or affiliate revenue.
- **Medium Priority:** An interview with a well-known sustainable fashion advocate. This is medium priority because it's great for building brand credibility and for reaching a new audience, but it is less directly tied to immediate sales.
- **Low Priority:** A blog post about your team's favorite local coffee shop. This is low priority because while it might be interesting cultural content, it is only relevant to a very small, geographically-specific audience and has no clear connection to your business goals.

### What You'll Need
To create a publication priority plan, you will need a centralized backlog of all of your content ideas. This could be a spreadsheet, a Trello board, or a project management tool. You will also need access to a variety of data sources to inform your prioritization decisions, including your SEO tool, your website analytics, and feedback from your sales and customer success teams.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and rank-ordered backlog of at least one to two months' worth of content. This shows that you are thinking ahead and that you have a strategic plan for your content pipeline. Another key indicator is when you can confidently explain the rationale behind your content calendar to a stakeholder. When you can say, "We are publishing this article next week because it has a high search volume, it targets one of our key customer segments, and the sales team needs it to help close a deal," you'll know that your prioritization process is working.
### The 'Why' Behind the 'How'
A publication priority plan is your primary defense against the chaos of a reactive content strategy. It provides a rational and objective framework for making decisions, which is essential for ensuring that your most valuable and strategic content gets created in a timely manner. This is how you can ensure that you are always working on the content that will have the biggest impact on your business.

### Resource Spotlight
- **Tool:** "Publication Priority Planning Worksheet" (Template 14.1)
- **Tool:** A project management tool with a good backlog feature, such as Trello or Jira.
- **Further Reading:** "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland. This book provides a powerful framework for thinking about how to prioritize and to manage a complex backlog of work.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Create Your Content Idea Backlog (1-2 hours)**
Create a centralized location for all of your content ideas. This could be a spreadsheet, a Trello board, or any other tool that works for your team. Go through all of your old documents, notebooks, and meeting notes and add every single content idea to this backlog.

> **Strategic Insight:** Your content backlog should be open to everyone in the company. Some of the best content ideas will come from your sales team, your customer success team, and your product team. Make it easy for them to submit their ideas.

**2. Develop Your Content Scoring Model (1-2 hours)**
In your backlog spreadsheet, add columns for four to six prioritization criteria. A good starting set is: "Search Volume," "Keyword Difficulty," "Business Value," and "Strategic Fit." For each criterion, create a simple scoring scale (e.g., 1-5).

**3. Score and Prioritize Your Backlog (1 hour per month)**
On a monthly basis, go through your content backlog and assign a score to each idea for each of your criteria. You can then create a "Total Score" column that adds up the scores for each idea. This will give you a rank-ordered list of your content priorities for the coming month.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Making Your Scoring Model Too Complicated:** In the beginning, a simple model with a few key criteria is better than a complex model that is too difficult to use.
> - **Ignoring Your Gut:** A scoring model is a tool, not a rule. If you have a gut feeling that a certain piece of content is a great idea, even if it doesn't score well, it's okay to trust your intuition.
> - **Not Reviewing Your Priorities Regularly:** Your business priorities will change over time. Make sure you are regularly reviewing your content backlog and your scoring model to ensure that they are still aligned with your goals.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Letting the "loudest voice in the room" dictate your priorities.** A good prioritization system is a defense against the "swoop and poop" executive who comes in with a "great idea" that derails your entire content plan.
- **Only focusing on SEO metrics.** While search volume and keyword difficulty are important, they are not the only things that matter. Make sure you are also considering factors like the needs of your sales team, the interests of your existing audience, and the overall strategic fit of the content.
- **Not having a process for saying "no."** A good prioritization system will help you to not only decide what to work on, but also what not to work on. Be prepared to say "no" to good ideas that are not as good as your top priorities.
- **Creating a plan and then never looking at it again.** Your publication priority plan should be a living document that you are constantly reviewing and updating. A monthly content planning meeting is a great way to keep it fresh and relevant.

# Publication Priority Planning

### What This Is
Publication priority planning is the strategic process of deciding which content to create and publish next. It's about moving from a reactive, "whatever comes to mind" approach to a deliberate and data-driven system for managing your content pipeline. This involves weighing a variety of factors, such as audience demand, business value, and strategic fit, to determine which content ideas will have the greatest impact.

This is not just about creating a content calendar. A content calendar tells you when you are going to publish something. A publication priority plan tells you why you are publishing it. It's the strategic layer that sits on top of your calendar, ensuring that your content creation efforts are always aligned with your most important goals.

By developing a clear and consistent system for prioritizing your content, you can ensure that you are always working on the most valuable and impactful content. It allows you to be more strategic with your limited resources and to build a content library that is not just large, but also highly effective.

### Why This Matters
You will always have more content ideas than you have the time and resources to create. Without a clear system for prioritization, you risk spending your time on low-impact content while high-impact opportunities are languishing in your backlog. A publication priority plan is essential for making sure that your most valuable content gets created and published in a timely manner.

This strategic approach is also crucial for maintaining alignment between your content team and the broader business. By having a clear and transparent system for prioritizing content, you can ensure that everyone understands why you are working on certain things and not on others. This can help to reduce friction and to ensure that your content strategy is always supporting the most important business objectives.

Furthermore, a data-driven prioritization process can help you to make a stronger business case for your content marketing efforts. When you can show that you are making deliberate choices based on factors like search volume, conversion potential, and sales enablement value, you can more easily justify your budget and your team's resources.



### How This Works in Practice
Implementing a publication priority plan involves creating a scoring system for your content ideas and using that system to rank your content backlog.

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For those new to this, the first step is to create a simple prioritization matrix. This could be a simple 2x2 grid that plots content ideas based on "Audience Value" on one axis and "Business Value" on the other. You should focus on creating the content that is in the "High Audience Value / High Business Value" quadrant.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At the intermediate level, you should be using a more sophisticated scoring model. This could be a spreadsheet that assigns a score to each content idea based on a variety of factors, such as search volume, keyword difficulty, conversion potential, and strategic alignment. You can then use this score to rank your content ideas and to plan your content calendar.

**🔴 Advanced Level:**
For a truly advanced approach, you should be using a weighted scoring model that is customized to your specific business goals. For example, if your primary goal is lead generation, you might give a higher weight to the "Conversion Potential" score. You should also have a system for regularly reviewing and updating your scoring model to ensure that it is always aligned with your evolving business priorities.

### Industry Examples

**Example 1 - SaaS (Project Management Tool):**
- **High Priority:** A cluster article on "best project management software for marketing agencies" because it targets a high-value customer segment and has strong buying intent.
- **Medium Priority:** A supporting content piece on "a day in the life of a remote product manager" because it's good for brand building but has a lower direct impact on lead generation.
- **Low Priority:** A longtail article on a niche feature that is only used by a small number of power users because the audience size is too small.

**Example 2 - Healthcare (Medical Device Company):**
- **High Priority:** A stakeholder-focused piece of content like an ROI calculator for hospital administrators because it can directly help the sales team to close a high-value deal.
- **Medium Priority:** A pillar page on a broad clinical topic because it's good for building long-term authority but is a significant investment.
- **Low Priority:** A company announcement about a minor award you won because it has a very short shelf life and a limited audience.

**Example 3 - E-commerce (Sustainable Fashion Brand):**
- **High Priority:** A comparative article on "the best sustainable t-shirt brands" because it can attract a large amount of organic traffic and can drive affiliate revenue or direct sales.
- **Medium Priority:** An interview with a sustainable fashion advocate because it's good for building brand credibility but is less directly tied to sales.
- **Low Priority:** A blog post about your team's favorite local coffee shop because it's only relevant to a very small, geographically-specific audience.

### What You'll Need
To create a publication priority plan, you will need a centralized backlog of all of your content ideas. This could be a spreadsheet, a Trello board, or a project management tool. You will also need access to a variety of data sources to inform your prioritization decisions, including your SEO tool, your website analytics, and feedback from your sales and customer success teams.

### Measuring Progress
You are making progress when you have a clear and rank-ordered backlog of at least one to two months' worth of content. This shows that you are thinking ahead and that you have a strategic plan for your content pipeline. Another key indicator is when you can confidently explain the rationale behind your content calendar to a stakeholder. When you can say, "We are publishing this article next week because it has a high search volume, it targets one of our key customer segments, and the sales team needs it to help close a deal," you'll know that your prioritization process is working.

### Your Action Steps

**1. Create Your Content Idea Backlog (1-2 hours)**
Create a centralized location for all of your content ideas. This could be a spreadsheet, a Trello board, or any other tool that works for your team. Go through all of your old documents, notebooks, and meeting notes and add every single content idea to this backlog.

> **Strategic Insight:** Your content backlog should be open to everyone in the company. Some of the best content ideas will come from your sales team, your customer success team, and your product team. Make it easy for them to submit their ideas.

**2. Develop Your Content Scoring Model (1-2 hours)**
In your backlog spreadsheet, add columns for four to six prioritization criteria. A good starting set is: "Search Volume," "Keyword Difficulty," "Business Value," and "Strategic Fit." For each criterion, create a simple scoring scale (e.g., 1-5).

**3. Score and Prioritize Your Backlog (1 hour per month)**
On a monthly basis, go through your content backlog and assign a score to each idea for each of your criteria. You can then create a "Total Score" column that adds up the scores for each idea. This will give you a rank-ordered list of your content priorities for the coming month.

> **Common Mistakes During This Step:**
> - **Making Your Scoring Model Too Complicated:** In the beginning, a simple model with a few key criteria is better than a complex model that is too difficult to use.
> - **Ignoring Your Gut:** A scoring model is a tool, not a rule. If you have a gut feeling that a certain piece of content is a great idea, even if it doesn't score well, it's okay to trust your intuition.
> - **Not Reviewing Your Priorities Regularly:** Your business priorities will change over time. Make sure you are regularly reviewing your content backlog and your scoring model to ensure that they are still aligned with your goals.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Letting the "loudest voice in the room" dictate your priorities.** A good prioritization system is a defense against the "swoop and poop" executive who comes in with a "great idea" that derails your entire content plan.
- **Only focusing on SEO metrics.** While search volume and keyword difficulty are important, they are not the only things that matter. Make sure you are also considering factors like the needs of your sales team, the interests of your existing audience, and the overall strategic fit of the content.
- **Not having a process for saying "no."** A good prioritization system will help you to not only decide what to work on, but also what not to work on. Be prepared to say "no" to good ideas that are not as good as your top priorities.
- **Creating a plan and then never looking at it again.** Your publication priority plan should be a living document that you are constantly reviewing and updating. A monthly content planning meeting is a great way to keep it fresh and relevant.

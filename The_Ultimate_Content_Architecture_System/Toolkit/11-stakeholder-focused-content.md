# 11. Stakeholder-Focused Content

### What This Is
Stakeholder-focused content is tailored to the specific roles, responsibilities, and motivations of the different people involved in a buying decision. While industry-focused content adapts to the "where," stakeholder-focused content adapts to the "who." It recognizes that a CFO, an IT manager, and a daily user all have different questions and priorities, even when they work at the same company.

### Why This Matters
In most B2B sales (and even many complex B2C sales), the buying decision is made by a committee, not an individual. If your content only speaks to one person in that group, you're leaving the others unpersuaded. By creating content for each stakeholder, you equip your internal champion to make the case to their colleagues, addressing every concern and building consensus around your solution.

### Your Action Steps
Your goal in this section is to equip your internal champion by creating content that speaks to every member of the buying committee. You will begin by using the "Stakeholder Content Planning Worksheet" to map out the key personas involved in a typical purchase decision. For each persona, you will then create a detailed profile of their unique goals, fears, and success metrics. This process will enable you to move beyond one-size-fits-all content and create targeted assets that address the specific concerns of each decision-maker.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Stakeholder Content Planning Worksheet" (Template 11.1).
- [ ] List all the job titles involved in a recent customer deal.
- [ ] Group these titles into 3-5 core stakeholder personas.
- [ ] For each persona, create a profile detailing their primary goal, top concern, and key question.
- [ ] Brainstorm 3-5 specific content titles for each stakeholder that directly address their needs.
- [ ] Create an outline for one of these content pieces.

You will know you have successfully completed this step when you have a set of detailed stakeholder personas and a list of targeted content ideas for each. The ultimate success of this strategy will be a noticeable shortening of your sales cycle, as your content will proactively address the objections of the entire buying committee, making it easier for your champions to build internal consensus.

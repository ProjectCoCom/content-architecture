# 20. Team & Resource Assessment

### What This Is
Team and resource assessment is the process of evaluating your internal and external capabilities to execute your content architecture plan. It involves honestly answering the questions: "Who is going to do all this work?" and "What do we need to be successful?" This includes assessing skills, time, budget, and tools.

### Why This Matters
A brilliant content strategy is useless without the resources to execute it. A realistic assessment of your capabilities prevents you from creating a plan that's dead on arrival. It helps you make smart decisions about what to do in-house, what to outsource, where to invest in training, and what tools to purchase, ensuring your ambition is matched by your ability to deliver.

### Your Action Steps
The goal of this step is to ensure your content ambitions are aligned with your available resources. You will conduct a frank assessment of your team's skills and capacity to identify any gaps. Using the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet," you will perform a skills inventory, estimate the time commitment your content plan requires, and create an actionable plan to hire or train for your most critical needs. This process will provide you with a realistic and achievable plan for executing your content strategy.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Team & Resource Assessment Worksheet" (Template 20.1).
- [ ] Rate your team's proficiency on a scale of 1-5 across the five key content skills.
- [ ] Identify your biggest skill gap.
- [ ] Estimate the number of hours required to produce one piece of content.
- [ ] Multiply that estimate by your desired publishing cadence to determine your weekly time commitment.
- [ ] Compare the required time with your team's available capacity.
- [ ] Based on your biggest gaps, write a one-paragraph job description for your first and most critical hire.

You will know you have successfully completed this step when you have a clear and honest picture of your team's capabilities and a plan to address any resource gaps. Success is having a content plan that you are confident you can execute, with a team that operates efficiently and feels supported, not burned out.

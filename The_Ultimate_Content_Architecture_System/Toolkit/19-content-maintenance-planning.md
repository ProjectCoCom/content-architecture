# 19. Content Maintenance Planning

### What This Is
Content maintenance planning, also known as content auditing or content decay analysis, is the process of systematically reviewing, updating, and improving your existing content to keep it accurate, relevant, and performing at its peak. It's the practice of treating your content as a living library, not a "publish and forget" archive.

### Why This Matters
Content has a shelf life. Statistics become outdated, best practices evolve, and what was once a top-ranking article can slowly lose its position to fresher content—a phenomenon known as "content decay." A maintenance plan protects your investment, ensuring your content continues to generate traffic and leads long after it's published. Often, updating an old post can deliver results much faster than creating a new one from scratch.

### Your Action Steps
The objective of this step is to protect your investment in content by establishing a proactive maintenance schedule. You will begin by using Google Analytics to identify your top-performing content assets, which represent your biggest opportunities for a quick performance boost. You will then perform a "refresh" on one of these key articles by updating its content and adding new value. Finally, you will schedule a recurring quarterly content review to ensure that maintenance becomes a consistent and integral part of your content strategy.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Content Maintenance Plan Worksheet" (Template 19.1).
- [ ] Use Google Analytics to identify your top 10 most-viewed content assets from the past year.
- [ ] List these assets in the worksheet.
- [ ] Choose one of these articles to refresh.
- [ ] Identify and make 3-5 improvements, such as updating statistics, adding new examples, and adding new internal links.
- [ ] Update the "last updated" date on the article and republish it.
- [ ] Schedule a recurring "Quarterly Content Review" on your calendar.

You'll know this step is complete when you have performed your first content refresh and have a recurring review scheduled in your calendar. The ultimate success of your maintenance plan will be the stabilization and growth of your overall organic traffic, with a significant portion of your leads and traffic coming from content that was published more than a year ago.

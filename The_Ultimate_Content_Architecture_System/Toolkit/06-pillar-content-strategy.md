# 6. Pillar Content Strategy

### What This Is
Pillar content represents your most comprehensive, authoritative content pieces. These are the cornerstone articles that demonstrate your expertise, target your most important keywords, and serve as the hub for entire topic clusters. Think of pillars as your content's skyscrapers—the most visible, substantial structures in your content city.

### Why This Matters
Pillar content establishes your authority in Google's eyes and your audience's minds. A well-crafted pillar page can rank for dozens of related keywords, generate backlinks naturally, and serve as the foundation for hundreds of supporting articles. Without strong pillars, your content architecture lacks structural integrity.

### Your Action Steps
Your primary objective here is to create the blueprint for your first piece of cornerstone content. This involves moving from a high-level idea to a detailed and actionable plan using the "Pillar Page Content Brief." You will define the audience, keyword, and structure for your pillar page, and gather all the necessary internal and external resources to ensure the final product is both comprehensive and credible. This planning phase is the most critical step in creating a successful pillar page that can serve as the hub of your content ecosystem.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Pillar Page Content Brief" (Template 6.1).
- [ ] Choose your first pillar topic and define its primary keyword and target audience.
- [ ] Create a detailed outline with 8-15 sections, listing the core questions each section will answer.
- [ ] For each section, note the cluster topic you will link to.
- [ ] Compile a list of all internal data and research to be included.
- [ ] Identify and list 5-10 external authoritative sources to cite.
- [ ] Brainstorm 3-5 ideas for unique visual elements (diagrams, charts, etc.).
- [ ] Draft a compelling introduction for the pillar page.
- [ ] Build out the full Table of Contents.

You'll know this step is complete when you have a finalized, highly detailed content brief that you could hand off to a writer with full confidence they could produce the desired content. The ultimate success indicator for your pillar page will be when it becomes a go-to resource, ranking for a wide variety of keywords related to your core topic and earning backlinks from other reputable sites in your industry.

## Source Generation Prompts

1. How does a content cluster strategy help to prove and build topical authority for a specific subject?
2. What is the process for breaking down a pillar page section into a multi-article content cluster?
3. How do you conduct cluster-level keyword research to ensure each article serves a specific user intent?
4. Provide examples of how a single subtopic can be developed into a "cluster core" page with multiple, more granular supporting articles.
5. What are the best practices for interlinking all the articles within a content cluster to create a tight-knit topic group?

## Video Overview Directive

Directive: Create a video overview that explains how to develop a content cluster to prove topical authority. The video must explain how to map out a cluster from a pillar subtopic, conduct cluster-level keyword research, and create a core article that links to more specific supporting posts, using a clear industry example to illustrate the process.

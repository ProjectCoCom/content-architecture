# 4. Core Topic & Authority Selection

### What This Is
Core topic and authority selection is the strategic decision about what specific subject matter your content will own. This isn't your general industry—it's the specific angle, perspective, methodology, or sub-topic where you'll become THE definitive voice. It's the intersection of your expertise, audience needs, and market opportunity.

### Why This Matters
You can't be an authority on everything. Brands that try to cover their entire industry superficially never become known for anything. The paradox of content authority is that the narrower and deeper you go initially, the broader your influence becomes over time. Master one thing first, then expand.

### Your Action Steps
The goal of this step is to make a strategic and data-informed decision about the specific niche where you will build your content authority. Rather than trying to be known for everything, you will select a focused topic where you have a unique perspective and a clear path to becoming the go-to resource. You will use the "Core Topic Selection Worksheet" to move from a broad list of possibilities to a single, well-defined core topic, and then develop a proprietary framework that will serve as the foundation of your content empire.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Core Topic Selection Worksheet" (Template 4.1).
- [ ] Brainstorm a list of 10-15 potential core topics.
- [ ] Score each topic against the five evaluation criteria: Expertise, Audience Demand, Business Alignment, Competition, and Passion.
- [ ] Select your highest-scoring topic as your primary core topic.
- [ ] Write a one-paragraph authority positioning statement for your chosen topic.
- [ ] Give your unique approach or methodology a memorable name.
- [ ] Outline the 3-5 core principles of your proprietary framework.
- [ ] Create a simple visual representation of your framework.
- [ ] Map out your topic expansion strategy by identifying 3-5 supporting topics and 2-3 future expansion topics.

You will know this step is successful when you can confidently complete the sentence: "When people think about [your specific topic], they think of us first because of [your unique approach]." Success is having a core topic that is not only strategic but also energizes your team, and a clear proprietary framework that serves as a filter for all future content decisions, ensuring every piece you create builds your authority in a focused and defensible way.

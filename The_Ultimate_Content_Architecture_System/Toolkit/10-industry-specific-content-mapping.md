# 10. Industry-Specific Content Mapping

### What This Is
Industry-specific content mapping is the process of adapting your core content architecture to the unique language, challenges, regulations, and use cases of a specific vertical. It involves creating dedicated content that speaks directly to the needs of your target industries, demonstrating that you don't just understand your topic in general, but you understand it in their world.

### Why This Matters
Authority is built on relevance. A healthcare administrator doesn't care about a generic project management solution; they care about a HIPAA-compliant solution that can manage patient workflows. By creating industry-specific content, you dramatically increase your relevance, build deeper trust, and can often command higher prices for your products or services. This is how you move from being a generalist to a sought-after specialist.

### Your Action Steps
The objective of this step is to increase your content's relevance by adapting it to the unique needs of your most important industry verticals. You will start by using the "Industry Content Mapping Worksheet" to strategically prioritize which industries to focus on. Then, for your top-priority industry, you will conduct in-depth research to understand its specific language and challenges. This process will enable you to create highly resonant content that positions you as a specialist, not a generalist.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Open the "Industry Content Mapping Worksheet" (Template 10.1).
- [ ] List all potential industries you could serve and rank them based on market size and revenue potential.
- [ ] Select your top 2-3 industries to focus on.
- [ ] For your top industry, read industry publications and forums to identify specific jargon and pain points.
- [ ] Create an outline for a comprehensive "industry hub" page for that vertical.
- [ ] Ensure the outline includes sections on industry-specific use cases, challenges, and case studies.
- [ ] Include a CTA for a demo or resource that is tailored to that industry.

You will know you have successfully completed this step when you have a detailed outline for an industry hub page that is rich with the specific language and concerns of that vertical. The ultimate success of this strategy will be when you begin to attract leads who say, "You're the first company that seems to actually understand our industry," and your sales team finds it easier to close deals in those target verticals.

# Chapter 7: Content Interlinking for SEO & User Experience

### What This Is

Content interlinking is the practice of strategically linking your pages to one another. It's the "connective tissue" of your content architecture, creating a cohesive web of information that is easy for both users and search engines to navigate.

### Why This Matters

Effective interlinking is critical for both SEO and user experience. From an SEO perspective, it helps search engines understand the structure of your site and the relationships between your different pieces of content. This can lead to better rankings and more organic traffic. From a user experience perspective, it helps guide readers to the information they're looking for, keeping them on your site longer and moving them through your conversion funnel.

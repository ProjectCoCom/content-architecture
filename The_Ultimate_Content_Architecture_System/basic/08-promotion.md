# Chapter 8: Content Promotion & Distribution

### What This Is

Content promotion and distribution is the process of proactively sharing your content with your target audience. It's about making sure that your content gets in front of the right people, at the right time, and in the right place.

### Why This Matters

Creating great content is only half the battle. If you don't have a plan for promoting and distributing your content, it's unlikely to reach its full potential. A well-executed promotion and distribution strategy can help you attract new readers, build brand awareness, and drive traffic to your site.

### Actionable Directive

Choose one piece of content you've already published and share it on your primary social media channel. This is the first step in building a content promotion habit.

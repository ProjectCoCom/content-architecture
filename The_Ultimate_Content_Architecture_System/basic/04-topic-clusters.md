# Chapter 4: Tier 2: Topic Cluster Strategy

### What This Is
Topic clusters are groups of in-depth articles that explore the subtopics introduced in your pillar content. Each cluster is dedicated to a specific theme and provides the detailed information that your audience is actively searching for. If a pillar is the book, clusters are the chapters.

### Why This Matters
Clusters are the engine of your content strategy. They allow you to target a wide range of medium-difficulty keywords, demonstrating your expertise across the full breadth of your core topic. A well-executed cluster strategy builds topical authority, which is a major ranking factor for search engines like Google.

### Actionable Directive

For one of your pillar ideas, brainstorm 5-8 major subtopics. These will become your first topic clusters.

# Chapter 9: Content Maintenance & Audits

### What This Is

Content maintenance and auditing is the process of regularly reviewing and updating your existing content to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and effective. It's about treating your content as a living asset that requires ongoing care and attention.

### Why This Matters

The digital landscape is constantly changing. What was accurate and relevant yesterday might be outdated and ineffective today. A regular content maintenance and auditing schedule can help you protect your investment in content, maintain your search engine rankings, and continue to provide value to your audience.

### Actionable Directive

Create a simple content inventory in a spreadsheet, listing all the content on your site. This is the first step in taking control of your content assets.

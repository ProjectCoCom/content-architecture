# Chapter 7: Content Interlinking for SEO & User Experience

### What This Is

Content interlinking is the practice of strategically linking your pages to one another. It's the "connective tissue" of your content architecture, creating a cohesive web of information that is easy for both users and search engines to navigate.

### Why This Matters

Effective interlinking is critical for both SEO and user experience. From an SEO perspective, it helps search engines understand the structure of your site and the relationships between your different pieces of content. This can lead to better rankings and more organic traffic. From a user experience perspective, it helps guide readers to the information they're looking for, keeping them on your site longer and moving them through your conversion funnel.

### How This Works in Practice

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
Start with a simple "hub-and-spoke" model. Your pillar content is the "hub," and your cluster content and supporting articles are the "spokes." Every "spoke" should link back to the "hub," and the "hub" should link out to all of the "spokes." This creates a clear and logical structure that is easy for both users and search engines to follow.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At this stage, you'll start to think more about the context of your links. Instead of just having a "related articles" section at the bottom of your posts, you'll want to include contextual links within the body of your content. These are the most valuable types of links, as they provide both users and search engines with a clear signal about the topic of the linked page.

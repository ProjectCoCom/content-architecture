# Chapter 9: Content Maintenance & Audits

### What This Is

Content maintenance and auditing is the process of regularly reviewing and updating your existing content to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and effective. It's about treating your content as a living asset that requires ongoing care and attention.

### Why This Matters

The digital landscape is constantly changing. What was accurate and relevant yesterday might be outdated and ineffective today. A regular content maintenance and auditing schedule can help you protect your investment in content, maintain your search engine rankings, and continue to provide value to your audience.

### How This Works in Practice

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
Start by creating a simple content inventory, which is a spreadsheet that lists all of the content on your site. Once you have your inventory, you can start to identify and fix any obvious issues, such as broken links, outdated information, and formatting errors.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
At this stage, you'll want to conduct a more in-depth content audit. This involves analyzing your content based on a variety of criteria, such as its performance, relevance, and alignment with your business goals. Based on your audit, you can then create a plan for updating, consolidating, or deleting your content.

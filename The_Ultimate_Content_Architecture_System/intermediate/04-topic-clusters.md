# Chapter 4: Tier 2: Topic Cluster Strategy

### What This Is
Topic clusters are groups of in-depth articles that explore the subtopics introduced in your pillar content. Each cluster is dedicated to a specific theme and provides the detailed information that your audience is actively searching for. If a pillar is the book, clusters are the chapters.

### Why This Matters
Clusters are the engine of your content strategy. They allow you to target a wide range of medium-difficulty keywords, demonstrating your expertise across the full breadth of your core topic. A well-executed cluster strategy builds topical authority, which is a major ranking factor for search engines like Google.

### How This Works in Practice

**🟢 Beginner Level:**
For each pillar page, identify 5-8 major subtopics. Each of these will become a "cluster." Your goal is to create a core article for each cluster that provides a comprehensive overview of that specific subtopic. These cluster articles should link back up to the main pillar page.

**🟡 Intermediate Level:**
Expand your clusters with supporting content. This includes articles that answer specific questions related to the cluster topic, case studies, and tutorials. You'll also start to think about interlinking between related clusters, creating a web of content that keeps users engaged and on your site longer.

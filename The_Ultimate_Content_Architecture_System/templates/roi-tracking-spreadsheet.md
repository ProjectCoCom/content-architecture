### **Notes**

*   This is a simplified ROI model. For a more advanced analysis, you may want to track metrics over a longer period (e.g., 90 or 180 days) and incorporate other factors, such as the lifetime value of a customer.
*   Attribution can be challenging. Use a tool like Google Analytics with goal tracking, or a more advanced marketing automation platform, to track the performance of your content.

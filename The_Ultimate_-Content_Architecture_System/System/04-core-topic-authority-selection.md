# 4. Core Topic & Authority Selection

### What This Is
Core topic and authority selection is the strategic decision about what specific subject matter your content will own. This isn't your general industry—it's the specific angle, perspective, methodology, or sub-topic where you'll become THE definitive voice. It's the intersection of your expertise, audience needs, and market opportunity.

### Why This Matters
You can't be an authority on everything. Brands that try to cover their entire industry superficially never become known for anything. The paradox of content authority is that the narrower and deeper you go initially, the broader your influence becomes over time. Master one thing first, then expand.

### Your Action Steps
Your first task is to brainstorm and evaluate a range of potential core topics. Using the "Core Topic Selection Worksheet," you'll list 10-15 possibilities where your brand could realistically build authority. Then, you will score each potential topic on a scale of 1-5 against five crucial criteria: your team's expertise, audience demand, alignment with business goals, the competitive landscape, and your genuine passion for the subject. This scoring system will help you move beyond guesswork and strategically identify the topic with the highest potential for success.

Once you've selected your highest-scoring topic, you must clearly define your unique position within it. This involves writing a concise statement that declares: "We will become THE authority on [topic] by [unique approach] because [why it matters to audience]." This positioning statement is critical for team alignment and serves as a filter for all future content decisions. Following this, you will develop a proprietary framework or methodology that gives your approach a memorable name and a clear structure, which will become a cornerstone of your content and a key differentiator in the market.

Finally, with your core topic and framework established, you need to map out your long-term expansion strategy. This involves identifying three to five supporting topics that are closely related to your core, as well as two to three future expansion topics that represent logical next steps for your authority. Creating a simple diagram that shows the relationship between these topic tiers and setting a rough timeline for expansion will provide a clear roadmap for your content strategy's growth, ensuring you build authority in a systematic and sustainable way.

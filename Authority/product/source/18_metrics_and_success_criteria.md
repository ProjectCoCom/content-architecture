### 18. Metrics & Success Criteria

**What This Is**

Metrics and success criteria are how you keep score in the game of content. It’s the process of choosing the specific, measurable numbers that tell you if your content is actually working. It's about moving from "I think this is a good article" to "I know this article generated 50 new leads last month."

This isn't just about pageviews. A smart measurement plan connects your content to real business results. It includes a handful of key performance indicators (KPIs) across the entire funnel:
*   **Reach:** Are people finding your content? (e.g., Organic Traffic)
*   **Engagement:** Are they consuming it? (e.g., Time on Page, Scroll Depth)
*   **Conversion:** Are they taking action? (e.g., Email Sign-ups, Demo Requests)

By defining your success criteria *before* you create your content, you can build a system for accountability and a culture of continuous improvement.

**Why This Matters**

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Without clear metrics, you're just throwing content at the wall and hoping something sticks. A solid measurement framework is your feedback loop. It tells you what's resonating with your audience and what's falling flat, so you can do more of what works and less of what doesn't.

This is also how you prove the value of content to your boss, your clients, or your investors. When you can walk into a meeting with a clear, data-backed story that says, "We invested X in content and it generated Y in revenue," you'll get the budget and the buy-in you need to scale your efforts.

Finally, data is the antidote to guesswork and opinion. A shared set of metrics aligns your entire team around a common goal. It ends the debates about what "good" content looks like and focuses everyone on the only thing that matters: creating content that delivers measurable results.

**AI-Powered Strategy**

Data analysis can be overwhelming. AI can act as your personal data analyst, sifting through your analytics to find the key insights and trends. You can use it to create reports, visualize your data, and even get proactive recommendations on how to improve your performance.

*   **Prompt Example (ChatGPT/Claude with data analysis):** "Act as a senior content analyst. I have uploaded a CSV file of my blog post performance data from the last quarter. It includes columns for 'URL,' 'Pageviews,' 'Time on Page,' and 'Email Sign-ups.' Please analyze this data and provide a report that includes: 1) The top 5 performing posts based on email sign-ups. 2) The 5 posts with the highest time on page but the lowest pageviews. 3) The average conversion rate across all posts. 4) Based on this data, what are 3 specific, actionable recommendations for how I can improve my content strategy next quarter?"

**Your Action Steps**

1.  **Choose ONE Goal:** What is the single most important goal of your content strategy right now? (e.g., grow your email list).
2.  **Choose ONE Metric:** What is the one number that will tell you if you're achieving that goal? (e.g., new email subscribers per month).
3.  **Set a 90-Day Goal:** Where is that number today? Where do you want it to be in 90 days? Write it down.
4.  **Put it Somewhere Visible:** Put that number on a sticky note on your monitor or on a whiteboard in your office. This is your north star for the next 90 days.

**The Path Forward**

Once you know what you're measuring, you need a plan to keep your content valuable over the long term. In the next section, we'll cover Content Maintenance Planning. To help you with this, we're building a **Toolkit** that includes a "Content Decay" notification system that automatically tells you when your top-performing content needs a refresh. **Sign up here to be notified when it's released and get a free guide to the 3 content metrics that matter most to CEOs.** *(CRM Opt-in Hook)*

### 20. Team & Resource Assessment

**What This Is**

A team and resource assessment is a reality check. It's an honest audit of the people, time, money, and tools you have to execute your content strategy. It’s about figuring out what you can realistically achieve with what you’ve got.

This assessment covers your entire content engine:
*   **Team:** Who's on your team (writers, designers, strategists)? What are their skills and how much time can they dedicate to content?
*   **Tools:** What's in your marketing tech stack (analytics, SEO tools, design software, AI assistants)?
*   **Budget:** How much are you able to spend on freelancers, tools, and promotion?
*   **Assets:** What "hidden" resources do you have (e.g., subject matter experts in other departments, proprietary data, existing customer stories)?

This clear-eyed view of your resources is the foundation for a content strategy that is not just ambitious, but actually achievable.

**Why This Matters**

A strategy without the resources to execute it is a fantasy. A resource assessment is how you bridge the gap between your big ideas and the reality of getting them done. It’s how you build a plan that you can actually stick to.

This is also how you make the case for a bigger budget. When you can show your leadership a clear, data-driven analysis of your current capacity and the specific gaps that are holding you back, you're no longer just asking for more money; you're presenting a business case. "With one more writer, we could double our output of high-intent, longtail content."

Finally, this process helps you get more creative with the resources you already have. You might discover that your head of sales is a brilliant storyteller, or that your customer support team is sitting on a goldmine of content ideas. An assessment helps you find and leverage these hidden assets.

**AI-Powered Strategy**

AI can help you build your dream content team, even if you don't have the budget to hire a full-time staff. You can use AI to write detailed job descriptions for freelance roles, to identify the key skills you need for a specific project, and even to help you screen and evaluate potential candidates.

*   **Prompt Example (ChatGPT/Claude):** "Act as a Head of Content building a lean, modern content team. I need to hire a freelance '[Role, e.g., 'B2B SaaS Article Writer']'. Please write a comprehensive job description for this role. The description should include: 1) A compelling summary of the role and our company. 2) A list of specific responsibilities. 3) The key skills and qualifications required. 4) The expected deliverables and compensation range. 5) A clear call-to-action for how to apply."

**Your Action Steps**

1.  **Do a "1-Hour Audit":** Set a timer for one hour and make a simple list of all your content resources: team members, tools, budget, and potential hidden assets.
2.  **Identify Your #1 Bottleneck:** What is the single biggest thing holding your content production back? (e.g., "not enough time to write," "don't have a good designer," "can't seem to find good ideas").
3.  **Brainstorm ONE Solution:** What is one thing you could do to solve that bottleneck? (e.g., hire a freelancer, buy a new tool, schedule a brainstorming session with the sales team).
4.  **Use AI to Take the First Step:** If your solution is to hire someone, use the AI prompt above to create the job description. If it's to buy a tool, use AI to create a list of the top 5 options.
